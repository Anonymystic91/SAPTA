8,-,Super comfy leather recliners.  Be careful not to fall asleep.
3,-,"Maybe because they are still transitioning? Food was served quickly, hot and fresh. However it really lacked flavor. I had an omelette, hash browns and the toast. Buddy had a sausage pony shoes.

7,-,"It was fine, typical coffee shop."
3,-,"This is so worth my time to make the 40 mile one way drive. Absolutely delicious ice cream. Never been disappointed in the service or product, it's always great. The only warning is you will likely have to wait in long lines. This place in the middle of nowhere is quite popular."
1,-,Quality vs price isnt what I expected
3,-,It''s been years since I've had a Burger King Whopper burger. Stopped into tonight and ordered this and small onion rings from the drive thru. Quick service and on my way. Ate the onion rings then went for the burger. All I can say is NASTY! BURNT BURGER AND IT WAS COMPLELTY A SLOPPY MESS. I won't make this mistake again.
6,-,"Were the knowledgeable people go for lunch. Hidden on the seventh floor of a non descript office building is the best Cajun diner in Chicago. Very reasonably priced, the portions are large and the food is good. Extensive menu although I find myself gravitating to gumbo or beans and rice. CORNBREAD. The place is wonderfully shabby and you can get a hot sauce education from the regular waiters who have been their for a while"
6,-,A great location for it's proximity to a wealth of things
4,-,"Jibarito was great, this was my first time but it won't be my last"

6,-,A good little shopping and food oasis in Glenview. Site of the old Glenview Airstation
4,-,Good for the neighborhood
3,-,I stopped on for a quick sub sandwich. Tonight's sandwich special is a Ruben. I ordered it and requested Rye bread and served hot. The sandwich was nicely toasted and piled high with shaved corned beef swiss cheese and sauerkraut. Very tasty and big enough that I couldn't finish it.
7,-,Good service but the food is nothing special.
7,-,"Good ice cream, cool shop."
3,-,Lunch with a coworker.  Had the lunch size portion of Fettuccine Alfredo and garlic bread at $6.45. Nicely prepared with a creamy sauce with great flavor.
6,-,Another of Hogsalt places. A little donut shop wth coffee close to gilt bar and 3 greens. Focus is on little
7,-,"Didn't try any food but the beer selection was surprisingly good. They had Zombie Dust which I rarely, if ever, see. Good place for after work drinks downtown. Upstairs has larger tables that can be reserved."
3,-,"Yep its a bar, not much else."
6,-,A good spot for every type of food in a casual setting.  Including wine and hot food. For more elegant go to the restuarant in the piana terzo section
7,-,Seems like an ok sports bar for locals.
3,-,"Not bad, had the biscuits and gravy with two eggs and bacon. Gravy to runny and needed a little more flavor."
8,-,"Nice dimly lit cocktail bar.  Not as fancy as Violet Hour or as dimly lit as The Victor, but still pretty cool."
1,-,Staff is super friendly
6,-,"A famous latin chain in all the Americas.  Most are fine dining ie ive eaten in Buenos Ares, Lima and Mexico City.  This one is more casual and much more a latin version of a gastropub.  Food is very good with interesting treatments of sauces and ingredients. Peruvian has an asian infl uence."
3,-,Definitely  spent some $$$ here on decor items.
7,-,"Very good pizza. Nice hybrid between pan and deep dish styles.  Preferable to the super cheesy pizzas at popular chain restaurants. Must call ahead of time and place order for the desired pizzas before arriving, if planning to dine in."

8,-,"I got a good deal on some electronics, but why do they have to have a Comcast sales person trying to sell me horrible cable and internet service while I'm walking around the store?"

7,-,"Fantastic thin crust, some of the best in Chicago.  Could be open later though."
7,-,"Maybe I made a mistake by going for the hot chicken sandwich instead of a burger. It was fine, but not very memorable. Good variety of spicy dipping sauces. Fries were oily and not crispy."
7,-,"I was lucky enough to be treated to Lawry's by the Google+ local team in Chicago. We had a lunch menu - sandwiches and side, not the dinner table side carving service. The sandwiches were good, but not outstanding and the salad was average. I would go again for the classic service, but the lunch was not that great. The decor/ambiance was awesome, it is housed in an amazing old mansion, can't beat that."
5,-,"Good food, there is not a hangover I've had that this can't cure!"
4,-,McDonald's steak is good on everything
6,-,I love cafecito. This one is at the polar opposite of the one on congress in a hostel. The food and  coffee is just as good
6,-,"Its very popular and the coffee is good but not the best. Poor selection of food. What i dislike, and is offensive is that they act as if their to cool for school. They are either to important to be botgered by customer involvement or they are down right rude.  The real problem is they are in my building which makes it hard to ignore them. There are better coffees and better shops"
6,-,The first of the boiled in a bag seafood places.  It's pretty good and one of the ways to eat seafood. You can't compare it to other preparations.
7,-,"Best Italian in the west loop, very friendly and attentive staff."
3,-,Doesn't everyone need a beautiful car. Great experience with the purchase. Staff was excellent to work with.

2,-,"12 different soup options every day the concept is simple, I left her warmed and full from the 16oz chicken soup, amazing!"
3,-,"Nice hidden gem, it's located just slightly off interstate I55 and the Toronto Road exit. It's almost out of view if you aren't looking for it.  This has been a Springfield staple for years. Food is very good and very close to a good home cooked meal. Staff are friendly and the coffee doesn't stop flowing. Someone is always coming by to ensure you have a full cup. It's worth the stop to grab a bite."
6,-,"Another of the selection of cigar lounges in the 3 mile radius of the city.  All have retail shops, lounges  for smoking and membership plans that vary widely.  This is modern spot near the olgivie stationn.  They have a nice selection and two comfortabl e areas.  They have a pricey membership and i didnt request to see the three other floors.  Next visit, as i will go again"

3,-,"Wife went to look for shoes, found a pair within 10 minutes."
3,-,"Checking for something they don't have, Krups coffee grinder."
9,-,Awesome spot! Huge outdoor area! Covered outdoor stage. Great atmosphere!
6,-,"My quest to relax and have coffee at all Sodikoff coffee shops continues. This is the best, with a ample space and eclectic and comfortable surroundings... and cocktails as well. This is the best coffee shop in Chicago.  While all of them feature coffee they also have a restaurant attached.  In this case you can have a special pastrami sandwich or an au cheval burger or a combination of the two.  Possibly the largest salad bar in the area, with both cold and hot choices.

Its not fine dining, but it is great"
7,-,"Food was OK, certainly better Italian in Chicago and suburbs nearby. Service was good and atmosphere is friendly and warm."
4,-,The food and service are great as always
7,-,"Finally got to experience Schwa after talking about it for years. The decor and ambiance is pretty cool, one of the most interesting and minimal layouts you will ever see.  Servers were attentive and friendly. They tended to rattle off the dish ingredients very quickly and without a menu it wasn't easy to pick up on each dish's composition. The music was fine, especially if you like hip hop from the 90s. Some of the dishes were quite good - the mackerel stood out and crispy mustard greens with ham broth as well - but many courses had flavors that clashed seemingly just to clash. The bigger issue was the level of salt in at least half of the dishes. I get that higher end places don't skimp on the extra salt, but this was overdone and really distracted from some of the flavors. At that price level it's pretty disappointing."
7,-,"Bulgogi burrito was good, would love if they brought over the bi bim bap from the original location."
2,-,Nice place for coffee and a pastry!
3,-,Lunch for a quick bite.
4,-,"The food was great as usual, I wish they hadn't closed the other locations"

1,-,"(Translated by Google) No idea

8,-,"Cool little bar with a great beer line up down the street from Wrigley.  It's pretty small, though, so it can get packed in there pretty quickly after Cubs games."
3,-,Was looking for a Nebo Big Larry LED light. Was told they carry them. They do not.
3,-,Stopped in to check it out. We will return for morning coffee and pastries.
6,-,An average upscale place. Food was alright Happy hour was not that special.
2,-,Nice brewery with a cool vibe used to be an old theater it seems
6,-,"A favorite of everyone. Very crowded, in a happening spot.  Food is good, but there are better burgers in Chicago. Not better shakes"
6,-,A good old fashioned Jewish deli
7,-,"If you like sushi, not just the over sauced, huge rolls at most places, go here. Sit at the counter and let Jun make whatever is good that day and you will not be disappointed. Creative presentation, and high quality ingredients."
1,-,I never go there lol
5,-,Life altering and amazing
3,-,Just stopped in for a beer. Nice small local pub.

2,-,Awesome sushi and all you can eat lunch special in case you want to get uncomfortable

3,-,"Nice small neighborhood park, larger playground and three ball diamonds.  Parking is located either on the east or north sides of the park. Basketball courts  and during the season there is a concession stand. The park is located about two blocks south of Schnucks grocery store if snacks or foods for are cookout are important to you.

3,-,"Very good food, definitely a return trips."
5,-,Great comforting staff
5,-,"I'd seriously play 2-3x as much a month here is they played anything besides crappy club music and The Chainsmokers on endless loop. Play the XIT music throughout the club please!
The kettlebells seems to have vanished from this location as well. I do commend the number of squat racks, though it does bother me the amount of people who use them for bench press and curls.
The locker room floors are also made of possibly the slipperiest material short of teflon, bring shower shoes."
9,-,"Walked thru on our way to the office, huge room, very nice!"
7,-,Some good options in this mall that are not available in the larger North Avenue shopping complex to the north and west.
1,-,Old fashioned and nice

Update August 2018, visited the dealership looking for a low mileage vehicle. Look at several just nothing in stock for me at this time. Staff was friendly and helpful. Maybe next time."
6,-,Great barbershop plus space
3,-,"Fresh ingredients, freshly made food. Not your typical everyday everything the same place to eat. Food was outstanding a d a bit on the upscale level without upscale pricing. Definitely worth driving to.the downtown square to enjoy a meal here. So good."
6,-,Avery nice Peet's in a lovely setting
3,-,Needed a van for a light move to Chicago. Reservation made a week prior for a specific van by Make and I'd # according to salesperson. Was quoted a price $163 for the trip. All good let's do it. Went to pick it up Saturday morning no van reservations in the computer for us. They did have my contact info in there however couldn't tell who put it there. So van was gone however they had another so it's all good....but wait now it's $238 for the trip. Well I need it and manager advised prior employee made a mistake. So Sunday I returned the van and salesperson checked out the van and came back and said I drove xxx miles and it would be $196...WTH. After talking to him the process was explained to me in better detail. My suggestion is they all need to have some training to provide accurate and upfront rental information.
5,-,Good food. Nothing was off the basics. So worth a trip
5,-,"Great atmosphere, great selections of food and drink, take a date here"

7,-,Good tacos. Not much more to write.

6,-,One of the only cigar smokers lounges in chicago
4,-,Still a great place to shop after all these years

My only complaint is the coffee bar is SLOW"

7,-,Portions are small but everything we had was good with the bolognese and kale salad as the standouts.
7,-,"Great regular dogs, the specials are a bit over the top with rich sauces - could not finish the foie gras dog."
7,-,"Tried a few gelato and sorbet flavors in my first visit. Butter pecan was excellent and the brown sugar cinnamon was a dead ringer for cinnamon toast crunch cereal. Root beer sorbet was good, but not on par with the gelato. They do run out of flavors and things are slightly chaotic while ordering if busy. Interior is spartan, but the product is very good."
6,-,A shadow of itself because of covid
4,-,They have the bomb on the French fries
1,-,Small and cozy
7,-,"Giordano's tends to get lower rankings than Gino's and Malnati's, but I think it holds its own and provides a good deep dish experience. Atmosphere isn't that inspiring however."
8,-,"I had a whiskey sour that looked great, and was very tasty.  They had a good bourbon list.  Beer line up is just ok.  I had the ""Jim Shoe"", and it was delicious."

7,-,"It's fine, like all the other TJs."

6,-,"A little underwhelmed for a mothership, for the purpose of staying and enjoying a cup of coffee. The draw is the freshly crafted coffee roasting where you can freshly roasted beans. Among their styles are a couple of winners"
7,-,"Skin and seasoning on the chicken is excellent. Really good mac and cheese as well. Small, but decent beer selection."
3,-,"So nice, best selection ever!"
6,-,All right Cantonese restuarant with all the popular American dishes. If your in your 60s and above it is what you thought a Chinese restaurant was. A little nostalgia with cheap grub
7,-,The purist and boiler special are fantastic. Balsamic is a nice touch. Only improvement would be a slightly crispier crust. Good beer selection.
3,-,"An enjoyable dinner with family. Chips, salsa, soup and enchiladas.  Very good. Service was outstanding"
7,-,Was able to get in and out without anyone asking if I needed help which is a plus.
6,-,An interesting slant on the chicago boat ride. Didnt go on the lake but dud go down to about 30th street. It was fun
3,-,Attended the Springfield art fair held on the old state capital plaza. It's a great event if your in the area stop and enjoy a couple of hours.
7,-,Bison sausage was good. Chips and bread were a bit soggy.
7,-,"Relaxing place for lunch and drinks. Beer selection is very good, including their own on tap selections. Food on its own is 3 stars, nothing special, especially for the prices, but the beer brings it up to good."
2,-,Dance floor though
4,-,The chicken chipotle pizza OMG
8,-,"One of the best Italian subs in the city, and everyone that works there is fantastic.  True hospitality."
9,-,Great shop! They do great work and let you know if they are getting over the original estimate.
7,-,"Surprisingly got in on a Thursday evening with no wait. Although the flavors were not as bold as the waiter described, most dishes were good. The Greek cornbread, roasted beets, and ham panini were the standouts. The menu is a bit overwhelming with small fonts and tightly spaced entries. Also tried the slider based on other reviews but it was average in flavor and consistency."
7,-,Food and service were good.
3,-,Looking for props. Found nothing except for high prices compared to the other thrift stores I've been in.
6,-,This park has the Oz characters
4,-,They have a wide variety and good prices
7,-,"Want to experience the most complicated parking garage in existence? This is your place. Defies logic. The theaters are nice and clean, chairs are comfortable. Previews seem to be longer here than other theaters."
3,-,Good place to stop for fuel and a drink.
7,-,"Great shoes, helpful staff."
7,-,"Have visited several times in the last 18 months. Beer selection is ok, and food is very standard bar fare, with a few specialty dishes focused on BBQ. Atmosphere is fine and the service is good, but with Beer Bistro across the street, this is a tough sell unless you are there for a game since there are more tvs."
6,-,Get old world pastries from an interesting place.  Genuinely Belgian
4,-,The pork chops are very tasty

7,-,Go for the champong and jia jiang mein. Unique and awesome dishes that you won't find at other Chinese restaurants.
2,-,Smoothies are insane!!
8,-,"Food was good, service was good, but the beer selection was lacking.  I know it's a fancy steakhouse, and that's not really their focus, but that's what I focus on, so they only get 3 stars."
7,-,"Great frozen yogurt, the chocolate/banana shake is fantastic."
7,-,"Good Indian, doesn't especially standout on Devon however."
7,-,Small plates and pizza are average. Nice space though.

6,-,"Renovated Hotel in the old Chicago Athletic Club.  Plenty of choices food, special choices for liquor. A good central location for tourists"
6,-,"A local pub near blommer chocolate in the jefferson fulton area.  Friendly and well stocked with spirits, beers and wine.  They serve pub food which i did not partake.  Plenty of tvs and a casual attitude."
3,-,Dinner with friends tonight. Three of the four of us order the baked spaghetti which was really good. The other had the bbn pulled pork and said it was good also. The pork is smoked on premises on a grill out back. Nice place worth giving a try. They also have a nice bar to enjoy while waiting on a  table.
5,-,"Convenient, good variety of food and drink, very easy to get to."
4,-,"Oh my God, I hurt myself the food was so good"
8,-,"The space is really nice, but this wasn't a very good experience.  We only ordered fries to munch on with our beers, and they took about a half hour to get to us.  A half an hour!  And they weren't even busy!  There's also something weird going on with the beers.  One of my favorite Jolly Pumpkin beers is ""Madrugada Obscura"" which is a sour stout that tastes kind of like a chocolate covered cherry.  I've had it on several occasions on draft and out of the bottle, and it's always been delicious.  I had one here and it was awful!  What is going on!"
1,-,Home improvement on a budget !
9,-,Worst towing company to work with in town.
3,-,"Found this last night by accident while driving on Lake Street. Decided to try it for breakfast today. Turned out to be a good decision.  We were greeted inside and explained all orders are placed at the counter. Breakfast consisted of a one page selection. However, we were quite pleased this IS NOT your everyday cafe menu. Unique items. My wife had a toast selection which was two slices whole grain toast open face topped with, avocado, eggs & pesto. Looked great and she has nothing but positive things to say about it. I had the hash dish (choice of three meats) lamb, chicken and pork served over home style potatoes,  green peppers, red onion and topped with two eggs of your choice.  Delicious, the portion sizes were more than either of us could finish. Additionally offered are several really nice pastries and a good variety of coffee drinks. Yes we will be back."
7,-,Nice variety of high end bathroom/kitchen providers and a decent food court.
6,-,A better foodhall experience. The dining room was much more comfortable and inviting than most. It was less like a hall with the requisite bench seating. Tables and comfortable chairs. Also a dining service option with a waitstaff. A notch up.
5,-,You owe it to yourself to enjoy this place
6,-,Just a fast foodhall with plenty of chioces but nothing distinctive. I had Green Street Markets and my friend had small cheval and the were average. I go them both in there origional spaces and these are a mere shadow of them.  FROZEN FRENCH FRIES

3,-,Appears they have nice high quality furniture here.
3,-,Its a Hardee's and they had coffee
2,-,Good beer selection in the heart of downtown
6,-,"A step above, especially when Marianos is imploding.  Still priced a little higher and dont have the popular commercial brand.  Good on bakery, cheeses, salad bar and prepared foods"
6,-,Typical gastro pub with nothing especially good or bad. A pkeasant spot for a happy hour
3,-,Great kennel with so much attention to given to your pet. Large recreational play area. Double fenced for safety.
6,-,Under construction will be a world class building designed by jeanie gang
3,-,"Still laughing, when we arrived at 6:25pm there were six other customers. Drinks order the food order placed. Took over 45 minutes to get the food. Food arrived, mine a Schnitzel and pub chips. Not bad. The other order was a grilled chicken salad with candied walnuts and granny smith apples....well no candied walnuts instead it was almonds, the grilled chicken looked nasty like it came off a dirty floor and the apples still had the core, seeds and the barcode label on them. OMG seriously? They did offer free bar drinks due to the delay. No way do we need to return here."
6,-,It's ok
4,-,"What a night, nothing but good times"
6,-,A Chicago Classic. The deep dish original

3,-,"Stopped in for some of the famous coconut cream pie. Didn't disappoint, it was delicious and so was the carrot cake."
3,-,This is an old establishment with a limited menu. Kinda the old style steakhouse menus. It's located in a historical building and it does have a small kitchen. So don't be in a hurry. Nice bar to hang at while waiting for the table to open up. Food is enjoyable and I must suggest the chive cheese sauce for your baked potato. So good.
7,-,"Shared a few appetizers and small plates. Very impressed with the ambiance and food. The duck pappardelle and root vegetable stew were excellent. Overall, the dishes had a great balance of flavors and textures. I was excited for the beer but found the 3 I had to be run of the mill, no real standouts."
7,-,"Although not awful, the experience here was not up to par with other top Chicago steakhouses."
3,-,Sunday lunch at with a 30 minute wait time. We were seated within that time frame. Waiter very friendly and engaging with us. The food upon arrival was like very nice in presentation. I have to say this place moved to the top of my list for a quality burger. It was cooked medium and the flavor was outstanding. Yes you need to try this place.
3,-,This is a must stop location! So much variety of soda's in so many unknown brands and quite unusual flavors. Tons of nostalgic candy. Great place for gifts for the hard to buy for person.
8,-,I hate how serve everything in plastic.  9 times out 10 I would rather go to Innertown.
1,-,Decent price but no pool and the room stunk
3,-,"Met a group of friends for dinner, nice service friendly waitress. Food enjoyable"
7,-,"Stock is not as comprehensive as Home Depot, but fine for most things."
6,-,A truly unique coffee bar. In the Acme Hotel which is a nicely renovated former dump on Ohio. Vast and comfortable surroundings with a scewed young vibe.  Has yogurt and pastries. A good spot to relax in a popular area.
6,-,The best view of Chicago
6,-,"Love this place. Unlike most food courts it is based on successful chefs. Plot an features owner chefs who havent broken into the big time. Had Indonesian and will go back for at least 3 places. Dont be confused, I like the time out market, but it's a different place"
3,-,"Buying paint, nothing exciting."
5,-,Grab your fav red wine and be prepared to feast!

3,-,"Yum, some wonderful treats here!"
3,-,"Can I give them a zero? Tried the Kiosk what a joke it didnt work. Stood in line to order which took way to long for this process. Order place and now the wait its 8:47am. People at the counter waiting on food. Food going out to customers but wait it's now coming back to the counter. It's the wrong stuff. How is that possible. More tha. One customer returning to the counter. Finally its 9:03am and my order is served, two egg mcmuffins and coffee. Its correct. Not coming back this place is a frickin nightmare in the way it operates. Second back experience at 2 different McDonalds this week. I dont need to go back. Done with McDonalds. I can get coffee elsewhere."
9,-,"Good food, decent prices, had a good time"
7,-,Nice atmosphere and service.  Food on the last trip was overly salty.
6,-,"Looks ok, but walked out after 10 minutes while the coffee was ""brewing"""
3,-,"Order to go, got home and pulled out bag of chips very small, disappointed. Food however was so good. Wouldn't have a problem going back here again and again. Delicious."

1,-,Every one was nice
3,-,Quick stop for coffee and donut.
6,-,"The new McDonald's. Spotless, modern, touchscreen ordering. This is their world hq, so everything is ship shape. Interesting twist is they have a limited global menu which features food items from other countries. I believe that they are rotated in and out

Otherwise it's a McDonald's"
1,-,Was cooler with the water park
3,-,"Food was great, waitress very special lady."
6,-,A text Mexico spot. Nice casual spot a little fancier

2,-,Awesome spot for a casual night out. Went hear the day the Kendrick Lamar album released and they played it in its entirety. Definitely coming back to this place

3,-,"Breakfast with the wife and daughter this morning. My food a breakfast bagel was quite good. Theirs scramble eggs, sausage patties and English muffin.  They both said sausage was not good and way overcooked and both said the English muffins were stale. Said to hear this because there wasabsolutely zero reason to turn out food like that considering we were the only customers in the parking lot waiting on food. Bad enough that we don't need to go back."
3,-,"I was in the mood for some fish, just wanted something different. Opted for the fish and shrimp special for $5.99. Drinks not included. Employees were slow, real slow taking my order. Once I received my food (to go) it was definitely hot and freshly cooked. Very tasty shrimp and fish. Didn't eat the fries, just didn't want them. Yes I'll give them another try in a a year or so."

4,-,If you brake down they'll pick you up
3,-,"Wife and I had dinner here last night. Chicken satay, California roll, Miso soup, Beef box dinner. Neither of us felt it was anything special. Both the chicken & beef (beef medium rare ordered) were overcooked and tuff. I guess this is why you don't here a lot of people talking about this place. I don't think we will be returning. Osaka is our choice."
3,-,"This was an outstanding dinner, cooked fresh and homemade flavor. So worth waiting for. The cookies...buy extra"
3,-,You can't go wrong stopping at a cracker barrel. Always a great breakfast served.
4,-,The food was good good good

9,-,"Cool spot! Very friendly staff! Daily specials! Darts, pool, gaming machines, plenty to entertain yourself with..."

3,-,Good place for chicken
6,-,"A good steakhouse.  All the trimmings, except baked potatos.  Make up with special mac and cheese.  23 layer cake.  Good bar with nice choice of appetizers"

3,-,After having a bad meal at Rock Bottom Brewery I had to improve my night. Only one way to do this. A visit to Oberweis for some fantastic ice cream. No way would anyone ever not be please with a very nice creamy flavorful ice cream creation. Its absolutely perfect.
3,-,I was in town looking at vehicles and had a little extra time to pass so I stopped in just to check this place out. It's not bad it has  potential of being better than it is

6,-,A nice little park in the West loop. Saturday Green City Market.
4,-,Mario's is a staple in the community for years and years
3,-,It's ok. I was surprised at the amount of vacant locations in this mall. You should check  prior to going to actually see what stores are open and if your even interested in these stores. With the amount of time spent there my wife found one store Eddie Bauer which interested her. Not a good day shopping for either of us.
4,-,The ham hocks where outstanding
7,-,"Small but focused menu. The handrolls are decent and it is a good value to order the 4 and 5 roll sets over a la carte. Blue crab was good, the others just kind of blended together without much distinction. Very small drink menu, only 3 sakes available. I appreciate the desire for freshness but when my dining partner went to that bathroom they tossed the unesten roll. Totally wasteful."
6,-,A local place for locals. Average pub fare.
5,-,Great brunch
3,-,Couldn't get waited on.
9,-,"Great Irish bar! Authentic Irish food, great drink specials!"
3,-,"Quality food at good prices, fried chicken was outstanding."
9,-,"Very large bar. Tons of seating, but can also get very busy, just depends on the time and what day. Not your typical downtown bar, not catering to the college kids! 2 huge tv screens with tons of smaller tv's throughout. Friendly staff, fast service, decent prices, HUGE shots!"
3,-,"Nothing needs to be said, perfect stop."
4,-,"Had a great time, and the concert was outstanding. I will be back for another event"
6,-,Use to be the rage. Now so many new openings it has been pushed aside. It is still a great place

8,-,"I'm a carnivore, so I didn't have any food, but I had a couple cocktails, and they were good.  My main problem is with the space itself.  It's on the small side, and just awkwardly configured.  Also, even when you sit at the ""bar"", you have to get up and order everything from a different spot."
2,-,"Really good vibe right in the heart of the train station. Tons of different options but seems as though the best places have really long lines! I settled for the lobster place which has very small servings, but still really good."
4,-,Quick and convenient
9,-,"Great spot! Good cheap food! Come in on Saturday for lunch, burger specials, drawings, good time!"
9,-,"Decent spot for food, huge dinning area, tiny bar. Has a salad bar for lunch and dinner. Does serve drinks at breakfast, if you're in the mood for a bloody mary with your biscuits and gravy. Large parking area, also has a nice outdoor beer garden."

5,-,Nice people. Good conversation
8,-,"Ramen was ok, but I prefer Furious Spoon, as far as ramen places in this neighborhood."
7,-,Not the cheapest salad around but ingredients are great and the portion was plenty large.
8,-,You can dip your fried chicken in BUTTER!!!  Decent beer selection.  Good sized patio out back.  The bar is SUPER tiny.  And you can dip your fried chicken in BUTTER!!
6,-,"A good old fashioned Italian restaurant with a modern vibe. The wine by the glass was good and well priced. Small selection but representative at fair prices.  Neopoltian pizza is among the top 4 in chicago, over which there are over 30. The crust was perfect and the tomato sauce had a hint of sweetness. I didn't try anything else but will on my many return visits"
5,-,Good sandwiches and beer
1,-,Never been
3,-,"Very nice relaxing club. Private membership required.  Food is very good, a great place to unwind."
1,-,Nice girl working
6,-,A new coffee shop very modern and large. By far the nicest of this small chain
6,-,A very good cajun creole restaurant with all the style. The gumbo was a good appetizer and had a rich dark brown roux. The fried chicken is their signature dish but the scene stealer was the greens in coconut milk. Go
1,-,Who doesn't like the tool store?
3,-,"Family dinner tonight, I opted for baby back ribs over a seafood dish. Ribs were pretty good and not to much sauce overpowering them."

3,-,"Dinner tonight for 4. No reservations needed tonight, just an average amount of people dining here. A few open tables available in the diniing area. Nice place cozy  atmosphere. They change up their menus monthly and offer specials also. Food severed, a nice presentation. Had a small food issue which was addressed and handled quite professionally. Thank you to the staff. Overall a great night, good food and wonderful desserts."
3,-,Bought horse feed and dog food. Love this place
8,-,"One of the coolest music spots in the city.  They have two stages so while one band plays, they set up the other stage for the next band, and just rotate stages all night.  It's pretty much non stop music."
3,-,Quality here is consistent. Food is always hot and delicious.
7,-,Vice has about 8-10 of their own brews on tap and available for takeout. No food except for popcorn so don't expect a menu. Ambience is nice when the weather is nice enough to have he windows open. Friendly staff and good beer - especially the DIPA.
3,-,I like the location based on my needs when in the area. Nice place on site parking. This is an upscale hotel and quite comfortable.
3,-,"The daughter picked this place out for us to try. Let me say right now, it was damm good. My wife was born in Germany and my daughter and I have had the privilege cost Germany on several occasions. So on to this place, walked through the door and your taken on a visual adventure. So many cuckoo clocks and German related items to see and take in. Had so much fun. Also live music sets the scene for an authentic dinner. It's a must stop location."

6,-,A good not special Italian restaurant with nice house wines and a good assortment of food.
8,-,"This place is small, and I imagine it can get really busy on the weekend.  I was there on a Thursday around 5:30.  Great cocktail, and the pork dumplings were delicious.  The bartender was a sweetheart, too.  This was like 3 Dots Light for me."
1,-,Great staff and prices
6,-,A good but not great pizza.  It is one of four Lettuce Entertaiment restuarants in a row
4,-,The burritos are the bomb
4,-,The chicken was good and hot

3,-,"Good coffee, ok donuts."
8,-,"Beer list is meh.  Didn't eat while I was there, so can't comment on that.  Bartender was nice."
4,-,Nice
3,-,"Great service, interesting small dinner. Food comes out fast. Meals were pretty awesome. Yes I recommend if you're in the area."
6,-,"A labor of love, which has begun turning into a special go to.  Books, mostly hand curated, and a local artist major gallary. The key is in the friendship that the owners bring which makes you welcome and offers you reading or art advice if you desire it.  Many services such special orders, books of month."
6,-,"Food hall had interesting choices, chief among the Rick Bayless"
3,-,Always a nice place to shop for the holidays.
7,-,"Food is good, and the menu has plenty of traditional options. Very large space, unlikely to need reservations unless you have a large party. Most recent visit the service was very slow, but that is not the norm."
6,-,I didn't think it held up to the hype. Possibly it isnt a brunch spot with a limited menu. You now can get phone everywhere. The waitstaff was I'll prepared and forgot half my order. Maybe it is better for dinner. Others seemed to enjoy it
1,-,Bartender was super cool !
7,-,"Great resource, lots of interactive displays."
7,-,"Had lunch there recently. Fairly small, maybe a dozen spots at the bar and a dozen tables. No TVs which is relatively unusual, but welcome. Menu  is obviously mostly burgers. Grass fed adds to the cost ($12 with no sides) but the ingredients are more costly and the one I had came out great. Small beer selection but all come from good breweries. Service could have been a little more attentive but no major complaints."
3,-,"They have a very nice selection, just didn't find what I was looking for which was a pair of Timberland black work boots."
8,-,"Great Mexican seafood, and cheap margarita pitchers.  Only 19 bucks!"
7,-,"Good tea, interesting location."
6,-,A FULL SERVICE Book store.
6,-,"A classic diner, swedish that is.  Breakfast all the time. Had the standard swedish pancakes good, but a rather tired ligonberry sauce.  Then more carbs with their cinnamon buns with enough topping to put me into a food coma.  There are 3 places and the one in andersonville should be the best.  Still, you must go every 5 or 10 years"
8,-,Books.  Check em out.
1,-,Hard to find your way around down ther
8,-,"Beer line up is just ok.  Service is usually good.  The BBQ is just ok.  The star of the show for me here is their Bloody Mary.  You get a piece of briskette, and you can add bacon to your bloody.  Anyplace that puts meat in my bloody gets major points!"
3,-,"Lots of flavors, lots of choices so I recommend starting from the left and sampling all the way to the right. Yum."
7,-,More expensive compared to other nearby options Le Peep and Hash Browns.
5,-,I'm too old for this place personally but the food was great and they did a great job with my nephews food allergies
3,-,"Stopped in for lunch today after aimlessly driving all over eastern Illinois. 1st impressions it's a nice place. The  guy who greated us was definitely friendly and welcoming.  Me us, drinks and after a couple questions about food items. He told me to quit looking and try the bacon chop hand pounded by Windsor Food Company a local meat  cutter. Took his advice and I have to tell you he was right, this thing has amazing flavors. Definitely will be back to try the steak dinner. Supposedly the best around. We'll see....."
6,-,"A great ramen shop, by a good chef. All the chooses."
2,-,"The interior is amazing, but you might not be able to find a seat during busy hours. I had to get a take away coffee but the coffee was good and strong nonetheless."
4,-,They had just what I needed
7,-,"Stopped in for lunch. Good omelette and burger, nothing that really wowed us. Solid service and ambiance, interested in trying the dinner menu."
2,-,"Wide variety of juices, usually a line. The acai bowl was very refreshing"
9,-,Friendly helpful staff for m oh st issues
6,-,"Based on my meal yesterday,  I would say I was disappointed.  I was expecting something special and it wasnt. Let's frame it 1 pandemic- probably makes  the expections lower, 2 maybe I'm not the target audience 3 the food experience,  see number 1. But the food was average.  The vaunted chicken sandwich was about no. 3 in the neighborhood.  The wines they featured should have been better and they were out of the oysters. The service was friendly but hipster average with the sandwich coming on what I would call an appetizer plate with nothing to garnish it.  I was disappointed but see number 1."
5,-,You need to come sample what's on tap and what's in store
5,-,Cures all hangovers
4,-,Simply good
8,-,"I got the chicken strips, and they were just ok.  The price and the portion was good, but the flavor didn't do it for me."
5,-,"They're the #5 new Brewery in USA today for a reason. Go here if you have someone who doesn't like IPA's and they'll love the Continental European beers. Take the tour with your beer snob friends to see some way old school brew methods. Good bar snacks and there are food trucks most days.

They just released some spontaneously fermented sours, if you thought their continental European beers were amazing, it's just the beginning."
7,-,Good lunch buffet.
4,-,That new vegee burger is better than the beef burger
8,-,Ok beer selection.  The Rueben was pretty good.  The bartender did a good job.
7,-,"Not a huge selection, but the quality is high. Picked up some prosciutto which was very well received."
6,-,Good place for frozen items or specialty items

3,-,"Biscuits and Gravy,  good stuff."

3,-,A very nicely kept beach. Highly recommend this for a day off enjoyment and relaxation.
3,-,"Picked this based on location and reviews. Won't stay again as it's an older establishment where they have done some updates, however it felt dark and dreary. Halls were dark and the decor look as if it's seen better days. The corners of walls had the drywall trim coming loose and beat up. Carpets old and dark which were very uninviting. The room although it appeared to be very clean was also dated. The furniture should have been discarded five years ago. Wife couldn't sleep because there was a loud buzzing/humming noise which kept her awake. Checking out of the hotel we went to the coffee bar and found all the coffee pots empty. I really can't see myself booking another Four Points Hotel. I just don't want to take the chance. Our encounter with the hotels service desk was great but that's really all I can say positive about this location."

3,-,"It might have been the time of day, not sure. Anyway bought a half croissant half donut which I guess is called a cronut. I also purchased a peach turnover and when I bit into it this evening, I find it to be a Cherry turnover. Was happy.  So I tried the cronut and found it to be on the dry side so I tossed it the birds. So my last item purchased was a slice of carrot cake. I didn't want to chance tonight so I'll save it for tomorrow for breakfast with a cup of coffee. So I'll withhold judgment since this was late in the day stock, however from the two items I had I was not impressed."
7,-,"Chef's special of the night was whole trout. Excellent preparation with citrus and herbs. Really enjoyed the fish and spring rolls. Slight twist on classic Vietnamese that works. They carry Beer Lao which is a treat as well, one of the better SE Asian beers available."
4,-,Simply one good hotdog and polish also
7,-,"Interesting and tasty beers made in-house, Orange Bomb and Jacob IPA were very good."
3,-,"Went in for some jump rings, grabbed them and left."
7,-,"Tends to have a less than stellar reputation, but I think it is on par with Malnati's or Gino's. Definitely a decent choice if you want deep dish."
3,-,Doesn't happen to me often but this breakfast was awesome and deserved the 5 star. Arrived shortly after opening grabbed a table and were asked what we would like for drinks. Very polite waiter. Drinks were served and order placed. Didn't take long before we received our food. Presentation was nice. First bite of my omelette and I was like this really has a great flavor. Very impressed.

7,-,The store is fine but the salespeople have to try and talk you into like 5 different services which is irritating.
6,-,A good coffee shop and bar that is part of Steppanwolf. Go there before or after a play or just on a whim. The coffee shop is by Goddess and the Baker with their typical selection. Plenty of seating

3,-,"Well this is somewhat of a surprise to me. I never knew about this place and I have family who lived in Lincoln. We were actually at a ballgame in Stanford, IL and Googled places to eat/get a pizza on the way back to Springfield. Sorrento's popped up and looked quite good. Destination set. Upon our arrival the exterior doesn't have much of a indicator/sign showing you have arrived. It's sits on the North side of the square and is a smaller location. Once inside it's like Wow, this place is nice. We had about a 10-15 wait for a table to clear. Once seated were we're immediately greeted and given menus and drink orders placed. Menu is simply Pizzas, salads and a few appetizers. No pastas. Pizza, wings and salads ordered. We also ordered some cinnamon sticks from the appetizer side. About a 15-20 minute wait and our food arrived. It looked and tasted awesome. Highly recommend. Fyi it's does have a BYOB sign on the hostess/cashier stand."

7,-,Good burgers and fries. Fast and friendly service. Now that there are a few in the city there aren't any lines. Even though it's good the competition in the West Loop is pretty stiff and Shake Shack only stands out as the quickest available.
3,-,Did the half grilled American cheese and cup of soup lunch. Good quick lunch.
4,-,"Great time, cold weather"
6,-,"You got to go. Great pies, which are offered in restaurants throughout the city. This little retail spot looks like it's depression era but dont be fooled.

8,-,"Beer list is good.  Karaoke on Saturdays, and live music sometimes."

I really don't eat much fast foods so probably be a year or so before I stop back in here."
6,-,"It is very comfortable and the staff is genuinely friendly. This is a major plus. The salad bar was a meal in itself everything from greens and the fixings to shrimp and lox to a complete chacuterie appetizer. The meats v
Were either very good or marginal. The leg of lamb and the lamb chops were uneatable. The various chicken and some the the red meat were very good. Pick carefully but worth going"
