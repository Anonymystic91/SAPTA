The only time someone has tried to hijack a plane on their own was when that AFrican bloke who was criminally insane tried to take over. But he really was mentally ill I think. If terrorists were going to hijack a plane and do something really evil and horrible, then I would presume there would be a few people, like a team of them. That's what they did on 9/11, I think.

4,male,16,Technology,Virgo,"           I hate Halloween. It has strange routes that nobody is quite sure about, it's a bit of a famine in the 1840s in New England, USA. It's a bit of the Irish about a man called Jack who made a deal with the devil, making the Jack-o-lantern - used to be in a turnip but the USA decided it would be better to use pumpkins as there were more of them. Trick-or-treating comes from Celts and was actually to give food to the needy on 2nd November in return for giving prayers to the dead on their path to heaven. It is the Celtic New Year as the summer officaly ends, acording to the Celts in 5 BC. There really isn't much in it at all. I'm sorry to be the evil and unsprited one, but I refuse to be sucked into this. Children running around wearing stupid masks  threatening  people to give them sweets which are going to make them fat. Old people have a terrible time and every year you read about an old lady somewhere going to hospital or having her house attacked.

5,male,36,Fashion,Aries,"           I just looked at the weather and it's supposed to be 30 frickin degrees in Minneapolis this weekend.  I may have to reconsider my visit.  It's 60 in NY right now.  How does one pack for such extremes??  I took a walk last night after work.  When I'm here in NY by myself, I don't have many options for things to do: I either go back to my hotel room and watch way too much TV and eat a bag of Pirate's Booty (my favorite), or I go wander around until the stores close and spend money.  I opted for the latter.  I walked aimlessly south.  I found myself in the middle of NYU's campus and thought about Ben, Felicity, Noel...and then remembered that they aren't real people...and that the show isn't even on anymore.  *tear*  Then I went through my favorite part of town: on Broadway through Chelsea, then south of Houston (hence 'SoHo'), and through the Village.  I went to my favorite market in SoHo, to the cheesy junk stores in Chinatown, and then to Dean & Deluca.    I may have a nice surprise for HAL and Stoner because of my aimlessness.  And the fact that I like to buy stuff for people when I'm bored.         "

Carnival games, bonfire, wagon ride to the trail, lots of lights and effects in the woods.  I was scared.  Recommend thinking twice about entering the house at the end -- in the middle it is pitch black in an enclosed space with no reference point, and if you're prone to claustrophobia or are afraid of buried alive, etc., take the 'Chicken Trail' that goes around it.

All I ask, and i think Abby will agree with this, is that you express you concerns, not attack the person.  Also I believe that Abby just didn't want to have to deal with school here and at school, she wasn't attacking you, as your reaction would show, but just reacting against school. (by the way its The Souls of Black Folk: Forethought;  Chs  1-5;  Chs  8-10;  Ch  14;Up from Slavery: pgs 1-50 (Chap 1-6)  and Ch 14 , if you're going to give her assignments at least give her the right ones)   Abby, I'm not really sure how to, or even if you need to, calm you down.  Rosie has backed off on her anti-Michael campaign, and if her reaction (to basically nothing) seems overworked, it's probably not you, it's probably something else.  so... if that covers it all, go back to you lives citizens  PS Rosie, if you really feel the need to get mad at someone, why don't you get mad at someone you communicate better with.

5,male,36,Fashion,Aries,"           Of course it was great, because it started out with The Darkness.     What was good:  Justin Hawkins' jump suits, lil' DJS knowing all the words, the eclectic crowd, and enjoying some beverages after the show (thanks, friends, for keeping it all on the DL).   What was bad:  the opening band (sorry...me no likey), the acoustics (thank God for earplugs), and the fact that my stupid ass was in the bathroom when Justin got up on someone's shoulders and played his guitar through the crowd.  F-me.  I ended up having a date on Saturday night: dinner/drinks on a roof-top patio and riding his motorcycle around the lakes.  It truly felt like summer.  Since I was concerned about him driving his motorcycle back in the middle of the night (and at bar time, no less), I let him sleep on my couch.  The dilemma there was: how do I get him out the next morning since The Dentist was coming to get me for brunch?  I told myself I'd be honest with each of these guys throughout this whole process.  But I couldn't bring myself to tell him why he needed to be out by 8am on Sunday.  So I lied.   'I'm going to church.'   Let's hope the God I believe in is a forgiving God, otherwise I'll see y'all in hell.         "

9,male,24,Technology,Sagittarius,"           Hi everyone,    I found a way by which images can be posted. Remember, Images can be inserted only, not uploaded. To insert images into the blog post, you need to know a little bit of basic HTML.    Say, I want to insert a image into the post say a Blogger logo. All I have to do is write the post as a HTML code.   --------  &lt;p&gt;  This is a &lt;b&gt;sample test post&gt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;  This shows how you can insert images into the post&lt;br&gt;  &lt;img src='aaa' width='xxx' height='yyy'&gt;  eg.      Note:  'aaa'=source image, the actual path of the image. You can find this out by rightclicking the image you want to be posted to the blog.  'xxx'=the width of the image to be displayed.   'yyy'=the height of the image to be displayed.  --------------------------    Try it out...    Bye,  Jax.            "

Since my novel has stalled since my move and the release of  'Grand Theft Auto: Vice City' , I haven't had the urge to finish my newest book.  It's currently stuck on page 110, where my kid hero is stuck in a swamp and is being attacked by spawning bog beasts.  Don't ask.    I looked at this guy's journal with total admiration and I decided that we needed to collaborate, that's all there was to it.  He claims he can't write very well.  I can't draw to save mine or anyone else's life.  Wonder Twin powers...ACTIVATE!  I sent him this e-mail and told him we needed to work on a project together.  He accepted!

0,female,24,Arts,Libra,"            urlLink http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0346/otis.php  excerpt - ALEC's model legislation, drawn up by its 'Homeland Security Working Group,' is called the Animal and Ecological Terrorist Act, and it ostensibly focuses solely on groups like Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front, which have attacked homes and development projects that threatened the habitat of several species. But more mainstream groups, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), are also targeted by ALEC as a 'threat,' and the bill would back that up with severe action.   For activists, the danger lies in how A4884 defines 'terrorist' organizations, as 'any association, organization, entity, coalition, or combination of two or more persons with the primary or incidental purpose of supporting any politically motivated activity through intimidation, coercion, fear, or other means.' Activist groups fear that lawful dissent, such as demonstrations, letter-writing campaigns, and leafleting, might fall into any one of those categories, particularly the catchall phrase 'other means.' The bill also seeks to prohibit people from gathering photographic or videotaped evidence of illegal or harmful activities, effectively shutting down the camcorders and other tools used by 21st-century protesters. Additionally, the bill calls for the creation of a state-run website where people convicted of 'eco-terrorism or animal-rights terrorism' would be identified with photographs and stigmatized, much as states do with child molesters.

5,male,36,Fashion,Aries,"            1) Do you have a favorite travel destination?  I would say Alaska.  I like that there are different rules there (the shortest distance between two points may not be a straight line; you can golf at midnight sometimes), and I love that everything there is so big, so grand and so unspoiled.  I have only been once, but I would like to go back.  I not a big repeat traveler, and I would like to go to so many other places, but it is difficult for me to imagine a time when Alaska does not hold a special place in my heart.    2) In getting to your destination, do you have a travel horror story? (flying, driving, riding bus, etc.)  Not really except that I learned the hard way that the shortest distance between two points in not necessarily a straight line.  When the 'highway' I took originally was jam packed with potholes that you could sink a basketball in (no, I'm not kidding).    3) Do you have a destination horror story? (got robbed, boring city, disgusting hotel, etc.)  One, I got pick-pocketed in Chicago.  I called the police, and they were all like 'what do you want us to do?'  When I got back to Kansas my wallet was in the mail (with all of it's credit cards and none of its cash) with a nice note saying 'I saw a man throw this in a trash can and thought you might like it back.  Happy New Year!'          "

0,female,24,Arts,Libra,"           I am going off of other people's words here, but, supposedly, the Ep II novel discusses spirits (for lack of a better word).  When Anakin has sanpped and is slaughtering the Tuskins, they pan back to Yoda and you here Qui-Gon say 'Anakin! Anakin! NO!!!!'  In the book, Yoda and Windu are puzzled by this, because there has aparently never been an reports of an afterlife or whatever you want to call it.  Taking that, you could assume that Yoda and Obi-Wan figured out how to live on.  Remember, Obi-Wan warns Vader that he will become more powerful than can be imagined.  Now, it does not explain Vader.  Mir - Obi-Wan did not communicate with Luke immediately upon his death, possibly explaining why Yoda did not.  As for sensing Leia, that's easy.  She was not attuned to the Force at that point, masking her from Vader.         "

He made sure he wiped his nads over the hardware - and some of those servers are now running BlogSpot. ewww.    Of course it doesn't beat Gazza's famous genital wiping incident. Apparently just before the France World Cup, Gazza and several other England players were apparently left alone with the Jules Rimet cup. Gazza is alleged to have wiped his bellend all over the globe bit at the top of the cup. So of course when you see the clips of people like Le Bouef, Viera et al kissing the cup they are in fact kissing a fine layer of Geordie smeg.

Mwahahaha. I loved the film. I don't think it was better or worse than the first. I think its partly because of the way the directors designed the triolgy. As with most trilogys the first film like X-men introduces you to the characters and the story. In this case its helping us to understand the Matrix. Now the 2nd and 3rd films will be jam packed of action as we see neo work out he reasons why he is The One. Btw, Neo is an agagram for one. Hehe.         "

Today I actually went in early to my dad's office. But now I'm sitting at home waiting for the mail to get here. We both want something in it so I decided to go home for a while and wait for the bastard...I meant postman, to get here. It's the worst feeling in the world to see him driving away without giving you anything, so bad that I called my dad to ask if he was coming back...so supposedly he is...so I'm making a little post whilst I await.  And then back to the mean city.   Tears.    "

I didn't really over-do it last night, it's more that I mixed things up.  A lesson you think I would've learned when I was 16 - if you're drinking beer, just stick to it.  Don't play the hero and down a mixed drink and then some cider and then back to beer.  The drinking definitely intensified when U2 lost (*sniff, sniff*) their oscar to the flash-in-the-pan Eminem.

Who: In reverse alphabetical order by first name, because I've always  hated  the whole school system of things, here's who's coming: Will, Rosie,  Lindsey, Josh, Elizabeth, Abby.  Feel free to invite other people, as  long  as I know them and like them. i.e. not Becca, any of Becca's  counterparts,  or anyone else obnoxious like Jared or Lumley, but God knows there's  more  where they came from.  I'm thinking, Philip or Jacob or Julian  (heehee),  people from our study hall would be good to invite. What: Birthday Party for Josh and Will When: Saturday May 17, 2003 at 5ish-10ish (I'll confirm those tomorrow) Where: Lindsey's house, probably basement Why: Josh and Will are turning sixteen   Bring: Your own snack/munchie/food...whatever   I will confirm all but the obvious tomorrow. -El Presidente  Oh yeah...I'm not going.

0,female,24,Arts,Libra,"           Think of it as a family for a second.  My father has 2 sisters and 1 brother.  They bicker and argue with each other quite a bit (at least they did when they were younger).  But, if someone outside the family, even one of the spouses of the four siblings, were to say something derogatory about one of them, the other three will circle the wagons and defend the other, even if what was said was true or something that one of them had said before.  That is the way it is here.  We can bicker amongst ourselves, bitch about the government, and even leave the country for a change, but if someone outside of here tells us we need to change or attacks us (verbally  or physically), we will tell you in no uncertain words to go f*** yourself.  Burning the flag pisses alot of Americans off.  However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys.  It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead.  The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot.  As for the security issue, the same NBC report said that security was already higher than normal because of some intelligence indicating a possible Al Queda attack.

It was kinda lame (only 5 multiple-choice questions), but I liked my score  5 out of 5 correct.  Your U2 trivia ranking is:  You sure your name isnt Bono?  That made me smile.  Today I remembered the new word I learned for cool.  My brother (younger, natch) refers to things as sick.  At first I thought he was saying slick, as in thats SLICK!, but then I realized he was saying thats SICK.  So then I thought that he was saying it wasnt good.  But then I found out that he was saying it is good.  So sick = cool.  I guess.  He said he got it from a friend he met in Italy who was from Long Island.  So I thought it was an isolated thing.  But then I heard someone (unrelated) to my brother refer to something they thought was good as sick.  I think it was on TV, or something.  So that means its probably not an isolated thing.

1,male,35,Technology,Aries,"           nobody reads this damn thing anyway, so i'll attempt to be poetic (and also because johnathan challenged me once long ago about knowing the meaning of love).  when we love and we feel that sense of spiritual understanding, that interweaving of self, and we hold each other and cry.  crying for joy because of what we have been given, the gift that we sense so few have had, and crying knowing that death, time, or own forgetfulness of that moment will take it away.   we argue about the petty, meaningless issues that make up our justification for an existence and forget the times when we were angels - and knowing that was all that mattered.  we look back in our lives and laugh.  laugh because of the love that we have encountered, the beauty we have seen and for each ending we know there is a beginning and the understanding that the cycle will continually renew.  or as john lennon would put it - 'why on earth are we here?  surely not to live in pain and fear.  why are earth are you over there?  when you're everywhere.  come and get your share.'  so, it's late, and that is my opinion about love ....

9,male,24,Technology,Sagittarius,"           Dear Kavi,  I noticed you used 'My final compre is preponed' in one of your posts. The word 'prepone' is used by most people (mostly subcontinental people) to mean the opposite of , i.e. move forward in time. Nothing wrong in using it , though if Sinduja and Valli use it in Uk or US, people might think they are blabbering. The right word to use would be 'advance' like 'My final compre has been advanced'. Note the 'has been' - past tense. You shouldn't use 'is advanced' - It is wrong.  Hope this small bit of grammar has been useful to you,         "

I kind of woke up and didn't, I was in 'between times', the scattered, minus-human zone between sleeping and wakeness for a long while, floating in sleep and anti-substance, for what seemed like hours. In the morning I was blinking sleep and rubbing watering eyes, and for some reason knew that I had not slept at all last night, for whatever primal human reason I have not stumbled upon. I did not, and in front of this computer I feel as a mouse feigning a bit too much before the wheels of a dump truck.  Another little tap of caffeine at break this morning. It's a shame I have all these excess Cokes, they're giving me an excuse to drink them at any time...which reminds me why I didn't sleep last night.

9,male,24,Technology,Sagittarius,"           Hi friends,  Hei what a nice inning by aussies! Really they deserved it i beleive. Anyway most of the time , i flet the cup is for indians. Its really good that atleast theyw ent to final! Every body played well in their team and so our guys could not meet them with the same vigour. Its ok.  So coz, of this match most of the people's weekend would have got spoilt......... But for a real cricket fan, aussi innings would have been a good feast. U know what, when we were travelling in bus to ISKCON yesterday morning, near M.G. road, u should see the josh of Bangaloreans....... There was a long proecession with a band of people playing, India will win and some thing like that. Then they were carrying a long flag around 50 - 60 metres length and in the end there was a tempo where in 4 purohits were sitting & doing a homam kind of thing. Even while returning in the afternoon, we could see so many indian flags fluttering. Reaally i felt them to be a bit stupid. Anyway its their way of expressing things and what does it have to do with me.   But i watched whole of aussie innings and then watched till tendul got out. After that it was becoming so obvious that we will give away the cup to them. so got back to my personal work. So i dont feel i missed or messed my weekend! How about u people?         "

1,male,35,Technology,Aries,"           An excerpt from Ebert's review of the revival of 'Eyes Without a Face'...  *****  '....One of the tasks faced by serious filmgoers is to distinguish good films in disreputable genres. It is insufferable to claim you 'never' see horror movies (or Westerns, musicals, war movies, teenage romances or slasher pictures). You're presenting ignorance as taste.  The trick is to find the good ones. The French auteur critics did a lot of helpful spadework, resurrecting genres and rehabilitating reputations, but they were not always right -- and besides, you have to feel it for yourself. If a film holds my attention, it is in one way or another a good one. If it moves or delights me, it may be great. If I am distracted by its conventions, obligatory scenes and carelessness or lack of ambition, it deserves to be tossed back into the genre.'          "

Maybe if you or manny could help me by suggesting a few pointers (not the one in C &amp; C++) on the topic, maybe some sites where you can get information.     Since I need some time to prepare it, it would be really helpful if you or Manny collect just the rough information and mail me (to my personal id). I'll try my best. Don't reply to my office. Any urgent message, blog it, I'll read it and reply asap.     Kicha, the answer to your question ' The man was a very short man. He could reach only upto the button for fifth floor. On rainy days, he would be having his umbrella. Using it, he can press the button for the tenth floor.' I feel that we can use the blog for these type of interactions instead of mailing. We have got the technology, so I feel that we should make use of it more often.     Ram: Sorry for not replying earlier to your query, which version of mozilla did you download?

0,female,24,Arts,Libra,"           Answer from the Middle:  Dean's status in the polls is founded entirely on an anti-Bush movement.  Ironically, the Left's motivation for this election -- we hate Bush, we gotta get rid of this man -- is very reminiscent of the Right's motivation in the Clinton era.  Both sides -- the Right, then, and the Left, now -- lacked, and lack, a vision, a plan, a drive to execution.  At 9/11, the Right reacted quickly with a vision and a plan, while the Left sputtered and blew the moment.  Now the Left can only play catch-up, and the only thesis on the table is getting rid of Bush.  The Left needs a vision, a plan, and a reliable leader to initiate the march -- one who won't throw it all away on a cigar and a beret.  Until that happens, they will flail about in vague, yet honest, frustration and anger.  For now, the Right has the money and the product:  Fear sells, and everybody's buying.         "
1,male,35,Technology,Aries,"           Ben - Your post struck a nerve, which surprises me.  While many of the articles/comics in the links you post piss me off to no end, I accept them as reflective of your views and not you trying to tell me how to act or think.  You don't necessarily share our passion (to strong a word but I can't think of a better one) for Buffy.  That is fine.  I don't get most of the song lyrics that are ocassionally posted here and have actually stopped reading them.  I don't complain about them being here, I just don't participate in the discussion about them.  While this group is small, it is diverse.  We all have things we like and don't like, things we will agree on and things we won't.  I like discussing things with other people, as I assume we all do or we wouldn't be posting here.  Please, let's not place restrictions on what we discuss.    I am not angry with you about your post, but it did pluck something.  I think JLS was correct in that if this discussion had been about B5, you would have been involved, but someone else who did not share your passion for it might not.         "

5,male,36,Fashion,Aries,"           Quick comment to Duf - it's clear that you don't watch enough reality television if that 'Obnoxious Fiance' show is one of the 'best tragedies ever displayed on television'.  I recommend regular viewings of 'The Bachelor(ette)' and 'The Real World' (emphasis on the Las Vegas season).  Although I didn't see any of 'MBFOF', I don't think anything there tops Trishelle having a three-way in the hot tub (with the other roommates watching) as an act of rebellion directed towards her dad.

After bringing up my problem to several front desk staff members and to a few managers, I finally clawed my way to the top - the GM of the Marriott Courtyard Midtown East - basically the CEO of the hotel.  I explained what had happened and expressed my fear as a 'single woman alone in [her] hotel room...'  I also used my 'preferred customer status' at Marriott chains (I'm a silver member, the lowest of statuses, but status just the same).  I reminded him that I spend thousands of dollars at his hotel, and because of this 'incident' I may be forced to not book here again.  'Ms. Panda, we are at your mercy. [No lie - those were his exact words.]  What can we do for you?  A free breakfast, perhaps?'  I went for the gold.  'I want a free night.'  An hour later, the GM met me in the lobby.  'I have comped all charges from last night.'  Score one for the single lady.  I got a $250/night room for free.           "

If I had those Choate, Hall & Stewart people at the beginning, I wouldn't even have gone to prison. And I learned how many people there are like me. Wouldn't hurt anybody, didn't hurt anybody, and people are spending their lives behind bars. There's no justice. But I also learned about my own strength. There are so many people who go to prison and give up, they say 'you can't beat the feds.' But I say 'fight every day,' and that's what I did. Every day, I wrote somebody about my case.

Last night was fun, I played  Chrono Cross  for about an hour for lack of anything else to do, went upstairs, hit the lights, and knew no more.  Well, I talked to my dad first, and he helped to alleviate some of that emotional distress I was talking about yesterday. My dad's a good guy, he can't do anything but justify my problems, which, I tell myself, is just teaching me that all the wrong directions I'm taking in my life are the right ones; but somehow I'm able to get his real message and things turn out better. It seems like his old girlfriend, the one that made me all screwed up last year, has started talking to him seriously, and he told me some vaguely suprising stuff. That he still cares for her in the way he did before, he says not much has changed since he talked to her last. At the same time, it's not a surprise, considering how involved they were, despite that relationship's brevity. At the same time, she's married, but I speculate she has the same feelings. It's causing my dad some undue distress; and that little segment only took two of the thirty minutes, which can tell you how much we can talk about in a short time.  Time for me to go.    "

3,male,17,Technology,Taurus,"           Okay Max, Maybe you need to get out a bit more? Well today woz judgement day, i went and saw lord of the rings. Now it woz a gud film although i beleive it could of been considerably cut down in length cause there were many parts you didnt need to see. Also the cinema didnt put a break in like they said a little while ago on there site! I was quite annoyed with that cause i didnt wanna miss ne of the film by going to the toilet! So i waited till it had finshed then rushed to the toilet, ask Andy Scott and DAvid i woz in there for a while! But over all a good film, i would advise you to go see it, but only if you seen the first two films otherwise you would get a bit lost in the plot! So wot are peeps Crimbo plans? Ne one going ne where specail? Tmor im working in the morning then going to my cousins for crimbo dinner, then sunday im working. On crimbo day i think my grandparents are coming over so that should be fun! Other than wokring thats about all im doing!         "

I skip looking at the full-priced clothes (a tank for $90? yeah right.) and make a bee-line to the sales rack.  I found a choice long, brown, linen skirt with these weird rips on the bottom...it had a sort of edgy look that I liked, plus, it was half off.  Sweet no?  This skirt sucks.  I wore it for the first time today to work.  The skirt fits strangely - it clings to my ass, but has a loose waist, so when I walk it slowly creeps down.  My ass was pretty much hanging out of it in the bus today.  Lord help me if I've turned into Thong.  When I walked the 2 blocks from where the bus drops me off to where my office is, I was pulling it up the entire time.  I'm sure everyone who passed me thought I had major problems.

Monday and Tuesday it was covered in the first half hour of the Today show (my only brush with network news anymore).  This morning it was not even mentioned.

It's getting to where I think I should get some muzak and outdated magazines for my cubicle as waiting room ('Duf the hygienist will see you now, scrape, scrape - why don't you floss?' - but I digress).    So, what I do is hit my mute button, explain my sign language (universally known around the globe and the whole world over for'well hung' or 'long') and ask if I can check in with them when my call is done.  Today, in a stroke of pure dullness, one of our slower colleagues replied by saying 'oh, okay, it's not important, I'll check back with you later.'  Which begs three questions:  if it's not important, why didn't you leave when I flashed you the 'long' sign?  What the hell's the matter with you?

0,female,24,Arts,Libra,"           Ok.  I'll bite.  For the sake of this argument, let's say that Trent Lott DIRECTLY said he was in favor of segregation and all the other race garbage from the South of 50 years ago.  Bottom line, he is entitled to his opinion, politically correct or not.  The last I checked, the First Amendment was still in force.  Why does he have to resign his post?  If the Republicans want him as their leader, that is their choice.  Keep in mind that, according to a black radio show host I saw on TV the other day (Tom Joyner?), 98% of the black vote in this country goes to the Democrats.  Odds are, the voters who would vote based on only the issue of Civil Rights, already voted for the Democrats because of the perception (wrong in my opinion) that the Democrats are more dedicated to that issue.  So, what damage is there to be done by taking the black vote away?  Politically, none.         "

2,male,17,Non-Profit,Gemini,"       I gave my opinion on Michael au personnellment (sp?). What a dumas of a kid.  I think that would be the funniest way to go. I mean, wow, you would really suck and hate your life if you died to your ignorance, man. Well, then you wouldn't have a life, so I guess it would all even out. Paradox!  Dude, everyone needs to go out and get Freschetta Oven-Baked pizzas. They cost a billion bucks but they are damn slick. I had that for din-din considering my mom is a cripple and doesn't really want to cook. It was that or another round of fast food, and my anorexia is suffering.   Well, another pointless post created, my work here is done.    "
1,male,35,Technology,Aries,"           I agree Mir, the man should not be tried.  They should have removed him from the speech site and barred him from reentry.  I don't know what the background of the speech was (i.e. was it a polotical fund raiser or a paid speech), but decorum demanded that the man allow others to hear what Bush was saying.  Once he broke that 'rule', he should have been removed, not arrested and charged with a crime.         "

3,male,17,Technology,Taurus,"           I would just like to point out Max that BBC News  is paid for  by you because you own a TV  Check mate... mwhahaha   I have newspapers starting from the year 2000 till present day of all important events, local and national - such as Prince Charles riding the tram!  Silence...   Found this from an amusing article called 'How to... study' in yesterdays Gurdian. 'Studying is copying things from books, and revising and highlighting the nouns what you have copied. But remember, your teacher probably wrote the book you're copying from, though when you've reduced his life's work to one noun, he might not recognise it.'  urlLink How to... study   What did I do today? Well this morning myself and Andy went skiing! But just before that we played with his ferrets, they are soooo smelly! But quite cute. The skiing was very good, soon as Andy worked out how to turn he was fine. Then this evening my family and I went to my grandparents for a meal and to talk about stuff such as house prices. Did you know that a 3 bedroom house in the year 1976 was 17,000? How much did your last car cost? Crazyness.  Anyway, my view on war if it has been said already there is no need to say it again. But seeing has everything has been said I want to say, I bid you good night and sweet dreams - I'm going to have a bath.         "

1,male,35,Technology,Aries,"           I've always had a soft spot for Russians.  I loved Dostoyevski and Tolstoy in high school; and in classical music, I'm always gravitating towards the overly lush sentiment of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov, and later the modern fellas Prokofiev and Shostakovich.  I love the snow, the cold, the brooding, the deep thought, the vodka, the fear, the paranoia, the lust for life, the memories of an empire gone by -- even the Communist menace was far more interesting and, dare I say, romantic than the rather dull juggernaut of capitalism with its good-old-boy GIs and giant golden arches looming over some foreign treeline.  I even miss seeing the uniforms and goose-stepping military parades of my youth.  And there is some small part of me that remains disappointed to this day that Soviet paratroopers never landed in the courtyard of my high school.  They are great chess players; they have delicious names; and they always longed for a warm-water seaport.  I dunno.  Just something about them, I guess.  I even like Chekhov, even though sometimes it's very much akin to chewing rocks.  Tasty rocks.  Yeah.  Um.  I'm gone.         "

3,male,17,Technology,Taurus,"           Yes i happily drink alcohol, but i have never drunk more than 3 bottles in one night, i have never got drunk and if there is no alcohol then i dont give a flying fuck. And from knowing my sister and her friends and half of the school most peeps are not like me, ask most peeps and there idea of a good night is going out and getting drunk so that they dont remeber a thing that happened! For me thats just sad? Why bother going out at all if your not gonna remebr ne of it? I'd rather go out and have no alcohol and be with my mates all night long! Just think Andy missed his own party cause he went over the top with alcohol.  Alcohol is just another thing for the government to make money on. In fact i dont even like the taste of most alcohol the only reason ireally drink it is to fit in, if i go to a party and everyone is drink ing then i will do it or peeps say- 'omg your sad, how can you not drink? your 16 not 6' I find dat quite annoying so i drink. I'm just glad im sensible not to drink to much to end up throwing all over the place! And just to let you know I'm feeling kinda stressed so if that sounds rude... Then it IS!         "
5,male,36,Fashion,Aries,"           I just entered Minneapolis as a potential spot for Dave Attell to do an 'Insomniac' show.  In 50 words or less, I had to try and sell this place.

1,male,35,Technology,Aries,"           Partially based on misinformation.  The part about him treating his people badly and having lots of oil still holds true.  What I want to know is, if the WMD thing craps out, but it's ultimately ok because he was a cruel man and now the terrorists have one less country from which to operate, can we move on and invade and occupy other countries with cruel leaders and ample land for terrorist hideaways?  Or is oil the only remaining prerequisite for us to provide this service?  Wouldn't it be funny if, upon invading Iraq, we had found no WMD, *and* the country had now run out of oil.  If the *only* reason left was the liberation(?) of the Iraqi people.  I wonder what the pro-war side would say then.  If they would gladly invade other countries, to gain *only* the liberation(?) of the populace.  Personally, I certainly hope WMD are found.  I'm ashamed enough of this administration's arrogant, bullying, cowboy, cartoon behavior -- what a fiasco if it wasn't even warranted.  Well, except for the part about the liberation(?) of the people, and the hidden terrorists in the hills.  Oh, wait -- and the oil.  Yeah.  I keep forgetting about that.

5,male,36,Fashion,Aries,"           I highly recommend booking a last minute cruise to the Caribbean in the middle of winter. Its cheap, you get to eat tons and tons of good food, and you get to sit in the sunshine.   Here are five of my favorite things from the trip:   1. Trying new foodstuffs.  I ate escargot for the first time in my life, and was introduced to guavaberry rum  which is really tasty in guavaberry coladas.   2. St. John  the island.  This extremely beautiful place is over 90% national park, which means its clean, not chintzy at all, and the snorkeling is cheap. Which brings me too   3. Sea Creatures.  Snorkeling was a blast  we saw stingrays, a shark, crab, squid (possibly) and an incredible range of tropical fish.   4. Folded towels.  Every night, our cabin steward gave us fresh towels shaped like animals  including a monkey, wearing my sunglasses.   5. Last but not least.  I thoroughly enjoyed having super-extended honey time. It was nice to not have to go to work every day, just to play and do whatever we wanted. And I was very happy to find out that after 7 nonstop days, I still cant get enough of the guy.           "

Theres been no small amount of chaos here at work, but the funniest thing just happened - I went out to lunch (I picked up my new golf clubs - woo hoo!!) and upon my return, workmen (ow!) were milling around and 1/2 the cubes in my surrounding little area had been torn down!

0,female,24,Arts,Libra,"           Perhaps the problem lies in our language.  In general, we have two words to describe a body type:  thin/fat; tall/short/; etc.  We are a culture of extremes and linguistically-enforced simplicity.  Our language is so pitiful that we often resort to numbers to express ourselves ('Are you happier today?' 'In terms of happy I'm about a 6, maybe a 7.')  For all the praise Indo-European languages receive, more often than not our choices are woefully limited.  Unfortunately, being creatures of language, how we speak and communicate greatly shapes our reality.  And so the wars begin -- often because our limited language limits our thinking, and thus our options.  No poetry, no grace -- only simple, concrete linguistic containers into which we attempt to pour the whole of our experience.  I love my car.  I love my wife.  I hate this pizza.  I love my house.  I love this carpet.  I hate that tie.  I hate war.  I hate flying.  I love my parents.  I hate the quiet.  For crying out loud.         "

Heron and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing...The Hebrews took the broken pieces and put them in the Ark. When they settled in Canaan, they put the Ark in a place called the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem, where it stayed for many years, until, all of a sudden, whoosh, it was gone.  (Gone?  Where?)  Nobody knows where.  Brody: However, an Egyptian pharaoh Shishak invaded the city of Jerusalem around about 980 BC and he may have taken the Ark back to the city of Tanis and hidden it in a secret chamber called the Well of Souls...

Any takers come up here on stage' ... 19-year-old Thomas Scot Halpin from Muscatine, Iowa, currently living in Santa Cruz, is in the audience at stageside with his hometown buddy, Mike Danese, who starts yelling to the security guard that his friend is a great drummer ... actually Halpin hasn't played in a year, but after promoter Bill Graham asks him if he can do it, he finds himself on the throne of his idol manning the sticks ... he holds his own for the final three songs, gets to party down with the band afterward, and eventually is named 'Pickup Player of the Year' by Rolling Stone... '  How crunk is that?        "

5,male,36,Fashion,Aries,"            Room on Fire, Reviewed  By Duf Fer  I got the new Strokes album, 'Room on Fire,' yesterday (its release date), and it is very darn good.  I don't think it is as commercially viable as their debut 'Is This It?', but it is an impressive work.    In my view, their technical skills are neither diminshed nor improved.  They can still rock out, but they don't bring as much energy to the songs here as in the debut.  I think this is intentional.  They are quieting things down a bit, and just as 'Is This It' was a throwback to classic American Rock and Roll, this new piece is an extension with the lights adjusted to effect a different mood.    The opening track 'What Ever Happened?'  Seems like a VH1 joke disguised as a love song and is clearly the high point on the disc.  'I want to be forgotten, and I don't want to be reminded...'  The low point?  There really isn't one.    'Between Love and Hate' is another favorite.  Overall 'Room on Fire' is a solid effort that does not topple the primacy or primal-cy of their original effort but establishes The Strokes as a band with its own distinct and wonderful sound and furthers their effort to resurrect pure American rock-and-roll.

0,female,24,Arts,Libra,"           i think you may be putting much more thought into your analysis of the movie than was actually put into the script for attack of the clones or phantom menace.  the issues you are pointing out are due to inconsistency on the part of george lucas.   then again, one could argue why was obi-wan able to communicate with luke after his death but yoda wasn't? or why darth vader could sense luke but couldn't sense leia ? my point being is that there are no real answers to these questions - we could conjecture on what the answers are but none of these very valid points were addressed in the movies so we can only assume that it was lucas who was not paying attention to the details of his films.

We've been to the moon, kicked around the dust, and gotten the t-shirt.  What's the point?  I wanted there to be a larger goal - Mars.  So, I was initially happy about the recent announcement.  But, the more I think about, the more I question it.  Don't get me wrong, I still am in favor of it, but I'm not sure that we will see the benefits of the initial establishment of the NASA with all the new technology, which is what everyone in NASA seems to be touting as a reason to do this.  Computers are already improving at a rate that puts them ahead of the software designed to tax them.  We are constantly developing new and better materials (plastics, polymers, ceramics) and other electronics.  I don't see where the demands of this new mission are going to have much trickle down into daily society.  Sure, there will be localized job benefits to the areas that get work on certain aspects of the project, but unless we get our kids back where they should be in math and science, those jobs will go non-Americans.  So, I am in support of the mission, with some reservations.  How about the rest of the blog?         "

I would enjoy being with you this week some more, but if your schedule is too busy I understand.  I'll wait to hear from you next week.  If, however, this is a round-about way of telling me you are not interested, I won't call or e-mail and be a nuisance.  I apologize if that isn't the case, but it seems becoming 'busy', particularly after a second date, is a favorite way for women to give me that hint.  If it is all the same, I hope I am wrong about that.   It kills me that I find absolutely no spark with this guy considering he could give me everything I ever wanted (houses, cars, stay at home with the kids...the works).  I can't bring myself to do it...as much as I try, I'm no gold-digger.  I'm all about planning certain things in life, but this guy is on a relentless wife hunt and actually told me he couldn't date a woman 35 or older because she would be too old to bear his children. ('You know...date a year, get married, no kids for a year, and by that time she'll be 38 and this decreases my chances of ever having kids.')  The irony in this whole method of thinking would be if HE had slow swimmers.         "

0,female,24,Arts,Libra,"           Having grown up in Mississippi, I can say with some certainty that I agree with my future husband about his assessment of Lott.  He is intelligent and charismatic -- and ignorant as Mississippi Mud.  And I believe he, like many whites (and blacks, for that matter) from the Deep South, have latent issues with racism.  But I also agree that it's a social, not political issue.  Mississippi & Alabama really are almost different worlds from what goes on closer to the Mason-Dixon.  I had never seen such unconscious segregation until I moved there.  I am very happy to be further north now.  Remember also, Chris...that while Lott was attempting (poor thing) to cover his ass on BET (once again, having grown up in MS...BAAAAAHAAAAA!  you have no idea how funny THAT was for me)....he was asked why he voted against making MLK day a national holiday...and he responded by saying (this was voted on in 1983 or so, mind you) something to the effect of having not realized MLK's social-political-historical significance at the time.  What a jackass.  As for his future in the Senate, I don't really shive a git.  I don't live in MS anymore and am no longer directly affected by his decisions.  If government is what it was built to be, i. e. an accurate representation of its constituents, then Lott is a perfect representative for Mississippi and its beliefs.  So there ya go. I'm done.          "

Perhaps they do go overboard but things like the recent Columbia crash will affect many things, like September 11th. War on Iraq will constantly be in the papers like it is now I guess but that will have a lasting effect. Some people like myself, like to read everything that happened ie: minute by minute, others don't but they have enough there for everyone I think. Plus your point about darren proves how its godo to know what is going on. Say your sister was in New York when that happened you'd want to know, even if you knew she was ok, what was happening and what was going on.

Some people drank too much, my brother did a hilarious dance to 'get' the garter, my mom complained about the photographer eating dinner at one of the guest tables, etc, etc.  After the reception, a group of us, including my bro and Sylvia, all went to Sylvia's parents' room to drink Polish vodka, meat, and pickles.  Those Poles sure know how to party!  Her mom was dragging everyone at the reception on the dance floor during the Beer Barrel Polka...and when the DJ played 'Believe' by Cher.

1,male,35,Technology,Aries,"           University of Connecticut physics professor Ronald Mallett, 57, said in April that after years of study, he hopes to begin experiments this year leading to genuine time travel, involving probably no more than a neutron or two at first but laying the groundwork for transporting larger objects. Mallett believes his theory is solid (straight from Einstein's Theory of Relativity), but that amassing the amount of energy necessary even to move small objects may be impossible with current knowledge. Mallett said he's been thinking about time travel since age 10, when his father died, because he wanted to go back in time to warn his dad of the dangers of smoking.

3,male,17,Technology,Taurus,"           HI, Welcome to Saturday. Just got home from Andys. It was great fun, had a really good time, and have some good photos. Ever the rain couldn't spoil the mood and atmosphere, well done to Andy for yet another, highly successful and well organized party. Although there is already things about the party I am regretting, doing/saying. Generally it was brilliant and nice to let my hair down 'as they say'. One word if anyone don't know what to talk about LEE. You could write a book on every day of his weird and mucked up life. It scares me. Talk to you all soon, Have a great weekend. Dave         "
0,female,24,Arts,Libra,"           An observation:  We seem unable to function without fear.  Whether the reaction is passive or aggressive, our identity seems almost entirely dependent upon fear.  Try to take fear away from the fearful, and they get angry.  There is a fierce pride in fear:  the fearful perceive fear as a sign of intelligence; those without fear are deemed stupid or ill-informed.  It is smart to be afraid of labor unions; it is stupid to be afraid of corporations.  It is smart to be afraid of our nuclear arsenal; it is stupid to be afraid of public health care.  It seems nearly impossible to make any decision free of fear.  Fear appears to be not an emotion, but rather the inescapable, invisible framework of human experience.  Without fear and our reaction to it, we are nothing.         "

I have looked at the courses I want and they all require a portfolio and a foundation dipolma thing some of which the unis actually allow you to do there and then go on to the course so actually Tom for me personally it is not optional and when I asked them about it they said you could apply without a portfolio but you'd have a much better chance of getting in with one seeing as one of the courses only has 45 places on it so yes, I do need a foundation course and portfolio. I can't even remember what the unis are. Only one I can remember is Nottingham Trent uni.  Cool Jackie I was planning on wearing a skirt as well!!! Lol. So hey we can be skirt buddies? lol.

She's kind of closed herself off from the public right now for obvious reasons, but might I suggest a call here in a day or two?  She's been wanting company for a while, as we all know, but now is probably the time of most need, so we need to make sure everything is taken care of.  Food, company, all we can do.

0,female,24,Arts,Libra,"           Hi, y'all. Just read the postings from the 21st & have to say thanks for the props, and (after 'Nice to meet you, Angie lass') DO WHAT YOU LOVE OR LOVE WHAT YOU DO. It took me five years in Richmond, miserable and aimless, aware of something missing that I could never identify, to get where I am.   Think on it now. You may still have plenty of time, but it will fly by. Decide what you want and go get it, girl. I know that you can do it.   It's smart to have a fall-back field, but unless you make your dreams a priority they'll become your second choice. So don't forget the training for your chosen path (as well as the practical path), and start laying plans now to meet your goals.  And Mir, I don't know CUNY law school but I do have a friend in Columbia law school (an NYU master's in poetry who's becoming a lawyer to please his traditional Chinese parents). But enough about subverted intentions.         "
5,male,36,Fashion,Aries,"           Panda, you are so smart. That  was  off a laffy taffy wrapper.   In other news, I am so proud of myself! In my writing class, I wrote an essay about swimming. I sent it to a little magazine here in town, called Twin Cities Sports. And do you know what? I think they just might print it. They said probably  but first I will have to make it a little longer.   I have not yet counted any chickens, but I am still very excited!         "

It's too soon- I'm not ready for it to start yet.  Ok, so technically I will never be ready, but I'm especially not ready right now.  And I need to get a job but I don't want to do it.  I just want to sit around all the time and be a lazy bum of a teenager.  This is the first summer I've ever actually done it, and I definitely enjoyed it way too much.  I don't want to quit.  But we have 9 days until school starts and I have all the new clothes and everything I need, now I just need the will power to make myself actually go to school.  It doesn't quite look like it's coming.  This year is going to suck and we all know it.  We shouldn't be here- we should be in college now.  We have to take a whole year of school to complete the 3 credits we actually need to fulfull to graduate.  This frustrates me to no end.  I want out- I'm sick of this.   Oh well, I'm going to quit complaining now.  It's not actually getting me anywhere besides depressed so I'm shutting up.     "

0,female,24,Arts,Libra,"   Having acquired the proof needed to clear themselves of the murder charge, the party accepted an offer from the shadowy K'Sh'Aal to eliminate the would-be crimelord who framed the party.  Given the discovery made after the raid on Grieson's heavily protected auction, it is unclear if the party succeeded.    Meanwhile, Ian and Gregory have decided to return to Tilverton to deliver an altered version of events:  namely, that Castillion died in Shadowdale, when in fact he did not.  On the eve of a rumored message arriving from the East, the party has been invited to join the mysterious Harpers; it is unknown if they will accept.    What is known is that the original fellowship that departed from Tilverton is broken, and that three strangers may be joining the remaining heroes as they take their first steps towards entering the ranks of those who hope to achieve the healing -- or, perhaps, the ultimate restoration -- of Faerun.

9,male,24,Technology,Sagittarius,"           Wonderful of you to bing out a topic for discussion. The question looks simple, but the answer isn't that simple. The more I get to think about your question, the more complex the situation becomes.   As I had quipped yesterday, if I had the chance to speak to our juniors, I would have stressed upon:     Know your core competencies  - You have to concentrate on what you do best or like doing best. Some might be interested in moving up in the IT segment and some in management.     Improve them  - Once you have identified your competencies, try to orient yourself towards it. Learn more about the areas where you would be best suited to.    Prepare a resume in line with your competencies  - Most people try coping a resume format from others. Break away from that line of thinking. Sit down and think of the job you are applying for. Write down what aspects of that job you are suited to. Prepare a resume that tells the employer that you are the best person to do the jo the job     More on this later.         "

1,male,35,Technology,Aries,"           For the record, I went back and checked the official FEC results of the 2000 election.  If every single vote cast for Nader had been cast for Gore, which is of course extremely arrogant supposition, then yes, Al Gore would be the president of the United States (shudder),  But, it would not have turned into the landslide that Ms. Randi seems to think it would.  Here's a big surprise (tic).  The areas with the most Nader support were areas that Gore won handily.  The only states in which there would have been a different outcome are Florida and New Hampshire.  The revised total would have been 295-242, the closest since Carter-Ford in 1976 (297-240).  That's a far cry from Nixon-McGovern in 1972 (520-17), Reagan-Carter (489-49), Reagan-Mondale (525-13), Bush-Dukakis (426-111), Clinton-Bush (370-168), or Clinton-Dole in 1996 (379-159).  Some interesting tidbits in reviewing the results- Some states do not allow write in candidtates for president (HI, LA, NE, NV, NM, OK, SC, SD) 3,315 people in Nevada cast a vote for 'None of these candidates' 1 Electoral College member from DC abstained instead of casting his vote for Gore as tradition calls for.  I am guessing that it was some kind of protest statement.         "

Weekend was non-eventful. lots of church gigs and I actually rented some movies. Saw 'Catch Me if You Can' and 'Good Girl' Liked them both very much. Catch Me was a fun movie but what I liked most about it is that it's based on true events. Some teenager in the 60s actually posed as an airline pilot, doctor, lawyer & teacher. talk about cahones. It shows what the power of donning a uniform and talking authoritatively can do for you. It's all acting, baby. In the DVD special features, you meet the actual guy who did all of this and listen to him talk about his experiences, I thought it was pretty fascinating because I can't imagine actually doing any of those things. The guy racked up about 5 million in forged checks and bank fraud, landed in jail for about 6 years but has been working for the FBI in catching criminals like himself for the past 20 years and he's paid huge amounts of money to design new security features for check companies. talk about the american dream alive and well.

I am really attracted to  urlLink Lili Taylor , and to  urlLink Illeana Douglas .  Dont tease me.  Im just being honest.      5. What popular trend baffles you?

Imagine if you have some 100 archivves, the whole page will be like flooded with archives section alone.  About All in a Day's work and Archives box looks too colorful (bright yellow). The blank space after Archives box also looks a bit odd.  We can have a single background color for the whole layout instead of 2 colors for the RHS of blog.

Lindsey: Hey Rob: Hey.  (few minutes later) I have a question. L: I have an answer.  Let's see if they match. R: What's the answer? L: No, question has to come first, that's the way things work. R: I think we've come to that point in our relationship (blah blah blah)... Will you be my girlfriend.  Sorry about asking online, but I'm a wimp face to face. L: Of course, don't worry about being a wimp.  And then the convo took a turn so we weren't talking about that anymore.  And I was behind him on the way home and he smiled at me and made my day cause he kind of ignored my existence today.  I'm rambling, so I'll shut up now.

1,male,35,Technology,Aries,"           It is quite likely that Jesus was a 'white guy'.  Now he probably didn't look like he was from Sweden, but rather he looked more like a modern day Middle Easterner.  Like Iraqis, Pakistanis, Israelis, etc.  And yes, they are considered Caucasians.  As far as the movie is concerned, and no I haven't seen it, I've heard that they don't have a single black person in the movie.

0,female,24,Arts,Libra,"           I was over my brother's house changing the oil in my car. I learned that Nissan to use a small size oil filter that my brother's oil clamp would not grip. They also like to hide the oil filter in a place where there no grip. It is amazing how tight the filter gets. I was pounding on it to loosen it to no avail. Finally my I asked my brother for a large grip wrench. He had none. Though he came up with the next best thing. A monkey wrench. At first I did not think this would work do the tight space, but sure enough my older brother's tenacity prevailed and he saved the day and got the oil filter off. Now one might ask why I not just take it to a Jiffy Lube. Well, they screwed me the last time and I feel better about doing it myself. So the lesson I learned to day is to have the correct tools for my car to change the oil. And now I think I will go clean up. Thanks for 'listening'.         "

If so, I am terrified to think that Dean might win the White House, as I have always considered Gore to be a fringe left wing loonie.  If Dean truly is left of Gore....  On a funny note, Dean is aparently raising most of his money via the internet.  If that is the case, he owes Al Gore two thank yous.  First for the endorsement.

For the sake of this argument, let's say that Trent Lott DIRECTLY said he was in favor of segregation and all the other race garbage from the South of 50 years ago.  Bottom line, he is entitled to his opinion, politically correct or not.  The last I checked, the First Amendment was still in force.  Why does he have to resign his post?  If the Republicans want him as their leader, that is their choice.  Keep in mind that, according to a black radio show host I saw on TV the other day (Tom Joyner?), 98% of the black vote in this country goes to the Democrats.  Odds are, the voters who would vote based on only the issue of Civil Rights, already voted for the Democrats because of the perception (wrong in my opinion) that the Democrats are more dedicated to that issue.  So, what damage is there to be done by taking the black vote away?  Politically, none.         "

4,male,16,Technology,Virgo,"           Just got back from a few days up in Manchester. I went with mother to see Ronan Keating at the MEN Arena. It holds 18,000 and looks small but you don't realise at first that there is a second tier up above you! It was a good laugh. The stewards were trying to get a Mexican wave going, eventually they did and it was so fun. The concert itself was better than at Wembley. Maybe it was because he had some more dates under his belt I'm not sure. Maybe it was because there were more people? And that the audience was younger? But it was good. Veyr good atmosphere, everyone was up for it and jumping about. When he came on at the back of teh arena for the encore 'Pump It Up' and the whole audeinece was clapping and stuff I could just picture this track being shown somewhere like the Hard Rock Cafe.

0,female,24,Arts,Libra,"           Katherine had a blast.  This was the first Christmas where she knew it was coming, so there was some of the childhood excitement around the house.  The boys had no clue that anything was going on, but they did like all the attention from grand parents.  The day after my in-laws left they spent most of the day crying from the dramatic drop.  And poor Julie at home with all three...         "

5,male,36,Fashion,Aries,"            First memory:  When I was four, my family went to California. At the beach, a plane flew over. My older brother told me it was the plane I was supposed to take  he said they were all going home on a different one, and I was going to have to stay in California by myself forever.   Favorite clothing:  I have a wide variety of favorites  one in each genre, whether its sweaters, jeans, t-shirts, long-sleeved t-shirts, underwear, etc. Im pretty much always wearing one of my favorites  today, Im wearing my favorite socks.    Morning ritual:  As a general rule, I drive to work in a high-stress, emergency manner every morning. If I am driving from my honeys residence, I even put on makeup in my car. Dangerous, I know  but it saves 10 minutes and I only do it at stoplights. From my residence, I drive on the shoulder and cut ahead of traffic. Again, its dangerous. I know. And even with all of this high-speed driving and other risky business, I am still typically 15 minutes late for work.           "

My mom has declared that since I get out early tomorrow I just have to clean my room and get it back the usual spotlessness. So if you just want to do all that you did today over, come one over =). I hate cleaning but I'm kinda like you. I'll go like a week where I clean the whole house and it all started with cleaning out my desk. Maybe my mom is trying to get me to clean the whole house since we have company this weekend. *shrugs* who knows. Anyway I'm prolly going to renfest on monday but i'm going to be with jacob and them with becca. She's been feeling low so i want to cheer her up and I know how you all dislike her. Sorry guys....I'm not choosing her over you at all...i just can't stand her moping. I'm still you alls friend and any other day I would choose you all but becca is....worrying me.

Is there anyway you can go through a brief lesbian phase just for the sake of more comedy?  All I gots to say is keep the wild antics coming, friend.  This DJ loves it!         "

QT movie in 2 sizes -  urlLink 3Mb  &amp  urlLink 11Mb .    Synopsis: a whale is found dead on beach &amp; local town too cheap to get rid of it properly so they stick half a ton of dynamite inside it instead. What they weren't expecting was the deluge of huge chunks of whale blubber (leave sound on - you have to hear the sound of falling whale lumps at least once in your life) - big enough to destroy cars they landed on.     I love the smell of exploded whale in the morning.

Yes, most old people roll up their pants (trousers?  where are you from, England?)  I'm assuming this is for one of your plays, but I still feel kinda weird about this... Anyway, I'll be right back.  I'm going to go check out your website now that they've  finally  got it launched.  And Josh, I really do want a cd of your songs, I wasn't just kidding yesterday.      "
9,male,24,Technology,Sagittarius,"           Hi,  Kavi, I thought of a book first. but as I am giving her a story, that idea was a no no. As for CDs, she doesn't have a CD player. I thought of an audio cassette. She liked one cassette. it is not available in Coimbatore. I tried buying on the net. I found it at Sony Music, but they don't have a delivery in Coimbatore. Maybe those in Bangalore can help me. The name of the cassette is 'Dance with Me'. It is a soundtrack, featuring Chayanne and Vanessa Williams. The cassette may be available at Planet M or online at  urlLink Sony Music . Buy and send it to me. I'll reimburse you ;-).   As I was working late last night, I couldn't go out to buy a present. Planning to escape from office later.   last night watched three films, 'Matrix Reloaded', 'Samy' & 'Putiya Geethai'. The two tamil films was watched by fastforwarding whenever there was a song or a fight or any sentimental dialogue or jokes. But I wached Matrix completely. An intellectual film, my brother was watching it when I went home last night. he said he was watching it for the second time and it is difficult to understand the movie.   The movie is totally superb, can't wait to watch it in the theatre.  Bye for now,          "
