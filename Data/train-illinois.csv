6,-,A luxury condominium
7,-,"Men's department isn't that great, otherwise a decent department store."
6,-,"A good, maybe great asain market. All over Chicago.  The prepared food was all right, not great and i love korean food"
5,-,Made the pain of seeing Trump sworn in less harsh.
3,-,"Updated 2-7-19 mushroom and $3.00 that they charged me $4.69 for. Swiss burger, over cooked on a stale bun. Strawberry shake not bad at all. Service in drive thru was reasonable. No greeting from employee at all, not good. Went frikin inside to inquire about price difference. The $3 one is only 1/4 lbs and the mushroom Swiss I ordered is a 1/4 lbs burger. Duh...yeah I know that but what's the difference. One is bigger she said. I'm done thank you.
Basic burger
Basic Dr. Pepper
Nice server."
3,-,"Had the German Chocolate ice cream, love it size. Perfect!"
6,-,Good multiscreen movie theater. Plays 1st run and special event rebroadcasts
6,-,Disappointed.  Considered one of the best but with two visits one good but not great and the other poor. Burger was dried out as if it was overcooked
6,-,"A good pub, which has ok food and better drinks. A very comfortable place"
5,-,"Ok 12 people on the floor, standing around, no service."
5,-,Great beer garden and brunch
4,-,Good food for everyone
4,-,What a porkchop
4,-,Loved those shrimp
6,-,A interesting place in a neighborhood with plenty of chicken choices.  Sample this an the others.
7,-,"Cool little South American inspired place on Fulton.  Service was decent, nice atmosphere. Kale salad was very good but the portion was huge. Cauliflower was a standout as well. Ceviche and steak we're good but not exceptional."
6,-,Great Italian sandwiches plus a convienant small grocery
3,-,Hanging with MITCH @ the Dew enjoying a bowl of awesome chilli. Numerous food items offered here. I just stuck with the traditional great bowl of chilli. Half beans half meat with normal suet and plenty of crackers. Spices on every table allow you to season you meal to your tastes. Cannot go wrong. Not sure why people are rating this as ok. I do agree it could be spicier however not every e likes it that way.
6,-,"The ultimate Chicago breakfast place, around since 1923. Stii crowded with all type from fresh of the bus or train to business and local government.   Everything is what you expect to be from the pancakes to the hash. The people next to me had biscuits and gravy and a turkey club. Both looked good. The give you free donut holes, pieces of fruit, milks and ice cream
The portions are big enough for two meals"
7,-,"Not an every day kind of place, but one of the most interesting dining experiences I have ever had."
6,-,"A bold millenial move is the Moxy. It clearly has the right vibe with liquor,  comfortable group seating enough board games and a fast food taco place. I'm not a millennial, but I have one and he would love it"
7,-,"Burrito was decent, not really much different than Chipotle or any fast food Mexican."
3,-,All I can really say is this was my 1st time here. The key lime pie was simply outstanding.
4,-,The host is very sweet and always helpful
2,-,Awesome brunch! Great cocktails!
4,-,Real good
7,-,Impossible burger v2 is fantastic. Posole was way too salty. Decent beer selection.
7,-,Beer selection and atmosphere is fine. It is absurdly large for a bar in the loop.
4,-,"The spaghetti and meatballs were just what I needed, now it's time for a pillow and a blanket"
6,-,"One of the most interesting restaurant interiors in the city. I would put it at the top 3 (katana and the pump room) the food at lunch was above average. Ambitious but but fell a little short of the mark. Salad was good, the soup was a little cool and thin texture, the tartine and duck confit were a good choiice but the were comprimised in their composition with the bread contributing too much.  I will go back for dinner. Wine by the glass should gave two or three more choices."
6,-,A good soccor pub. Haz all the requisite beers and pub food to make it appealing
8,-,"Great place to see some bands, or if you're not into whoever's playing, you can sit at the bar, and not even really hear the band, because the music room is pretty separated.  The bartenders are great.  Beer selection is pretty good."
3,-,"Great food, cold drinks a d a lot of fun here. Bonus it was karaoke night."
6,-,A typical gastro poll ub
6,-,"could be better, but pandemic hampered. The Jerry's in Andersonville was a better judge. did the space well. try again"
4,-,Loved it
5,-,Had the staff told me to call StubHub when I got fake tickets my night may have been salvaged instead of missing seeing Tool
3,-,"Absolutely awesome! Great place to buy and/or service your vehicle. Good selection of quailty imports and domestic cars. Just stop in and buy one. Worked with Brian, easy process."
7,-,Best airport food you can get. As good as Xoco.
8,-,"Nice place, but I found the same dryer for much cheaper on Amazon."
5,-,"150+ people virtually on too of each other to get in with at best 50% mask usage. If I'm gonna get Covid it's not gonna be here, no thanks"
6,-,"Triple threat. Restaurant, sandwich takeout and coffee bar."
7,-,Not exclusively vegetarian. Veggie burger and faro salad were really nice.
5,-,Bad experience. Cuticles left bleeding
3,-,"Typical breakfast foods, nothing special or different on the menu. Coffee is definitely very weak."
7,-,"Tried this new space out today. Really good chicken shawarma sandwich. Service is top-notch, they gave me samples of falafel and baklava to try out. Interior is completely redone and looks great."
3,-,"Perfect dinner, thats really all that needs to be said."
9,-,"This is a great bar for live local music, rarely a cover, and cheap beer. Cash only."
3,-,"Got gas, that's it. Never went inside."
3,-,"Very unique place, coffee and bakery items in the first room for enter. Very nice decor with numerous hand painted murals. Comfortable surroundings with a friendly hostess greeting you as you walk inside. Additionally the are two separate restaurant seating areas located in an adjoining room. Lunch and dinner menus offer more than enough varity to satisfy your tastes. I recommend this place highly based on what I observed while there. Food was really freshly made and quite tasty."
8,-,"Went here for trivia one night.  Place was meh, trivia was meh."
1,-,The definition of a good neighborhood bar .
5,-,"Good drinks, minimal snobs and yuppies, a rare great northern facing view"
8,-,"I've been here several times, and the burgers are good, but I really loved their fries and house made ketchup.  I'm not even really a fan of ketchup, but their's was so delicious!  Like so good, I always bugged them to give me some to take with me, but they never would.  Well, on my most recent visit I learned that they changed their menu, AND they changed the fries and ketchup!  They now seem to be whatever generic Gordon Food Service fries and Heinz ketchup.  SO BUMMED!!  Unless they bring back the old thin fries and ketchup, I won't be back.  There are much better burgers in the area, like Links and Small Cheval."
5,-,Good view. Wish the Hawks we're doing better
4,-,Real good food
2,-,Bali vibes this place is coconuts!
5,-,Great takeaway food. Fresh and healthy
3,-,Was looking for a Wescott diffuser. They didn't have one in stock.
4,-,The beef sandwich was good and the fries were delicious
7,-,"Food is ok, nothing special. Fine if you are in a hurry."
6,-,"A surprise.  It was good and comfortable with a satisfactory wine list, not overly marked up. It was modern and clean and if i was looking for a regular haunt i would choose this place in a heart bit.  The menu is share plates and fairly standard gastro pub, but it was prepared well"
6,-,"GOOD CONCEPT, BUT Disappointing.  Could be Covid related but with only a handful of customers it wasnt care. Food cold"
6,-,A slightly different take on a coffee shop. They feature fresh made chocolate versus a bigger assortment of food and pastries. Also has those  there is also a glass enclosed meeting room for guest s
1,-,Love the pizza
7,-,Food and service are fine. Place is ridiculously large.
3,-,Opted for their Calzone special served with a side Caesar salad for $14.50. Salad very crisp and flavorful.  Calzone was so tasty I almost ordered a second one.
7,-,One of the better beer selections I have seen around Chicago.
9,-,"Great food, and there's beer!"
5,-,Was expecting more food for the prices. Space was nice
3,-,So nice to find a place open for lunch. Plenty of inside room to social distance and plenty of outside seating with fireplace burning for your comfort. Definitely support this business and enjoy a great lunch.
7,-,"Fairly standard whole foods, larger than the West Loop location."
5,-,Great change from a typical bar.
8,-,"One of the worst bars I've been to in Chicago.  The smell punches you in the face 3 seconds after you walk in the door.  The bathroom is DISGUSTING!!!  I know Anthony Bourdain loved this place, but I can't even like this place a little bit.  Except for maybe the bartender.  He's a nice guy.  He's the only reason I'm giving this place one star.  It should be a zero."
6,-,Excellent.  Musuems have the best little restaurants throughout the world
6,-,Excellent. Everything was first class
7,-,"It's a home depot, pretty standard."
6,-,A small European style coffee bar with 4 small tables. Adjacent to a hotel where you can probably sit in the lobby
6,-,"Good seafood and a good, but not great happy hour.  Part of swift and sons.  You can havr half the surf and turf then go to the dining room switch to red wine and get yoiur turf."
9,-,"Awesome shop! Very friendly, accommodating staff! Blew a tire on my RV on the interstate, limped it in to the shop. Ended up replacing all 8 tires, for safety and piece of mind. Since I wasn't planning on spending this much, they helped me out and found a discount for me. Highly recommended shop! Very knowledgeable, very professional! Great work!"
3,-,Best burgers in Springfield hands down!
4,-,Good stuff
6,-,A haircutting factory. Will see after two days how it turned out
7,-,"One of the better steaks I have had in Chicago, and definitely one of the best 2 or 3 steakhouses in the city. A person in my party did send one back one visit, but otherwise food and wine were all high quality and done as ordered. Service was very good."
5,-,If you like pastries and coffee feet in here now
7,-,"Lunch spots have ridiculous lines, be ready to wait."
6,-,A local breakfast option. Old fashioned. Good ordinary food
7,-,"Awesome displays, interesting books and gifts. Don't miss the massive downtown model."
2,-,I came for brunch and there was a DJ so the place got pretty crazy. If you're looking for a good Sunday funday this will be a good place. The rooftop is the best part of this place if you can find a table.
1,-,100 bucks or more for a stuffed animal
6,-,A quaint old bar with plenty of atmosphere and good but not great food. A good beer list and pretty fair ribs
3,-,Had to stop in and grab a gyro before dinner something to hold me over. Foods delicious here.
3,-,Stopped in to buy the Nature Select brand dog food and some treats. Owner is very helpful and a great guy to chat with. Recommend!
3,-,"Locsted on Navy Pier and the pier is crowded today. Had lunch here, it seemed no sooner than we placed our order the food arrived. Wasn't too bad, it was hot but you can really tell it's all about turning over the tables and on to the next customer."
3,-,"Not impressed with the greeting I received. I want a specific car and express that. Here let me show you something else. Uh NO, I'm done here, moving on."
2,-,Best bbq in Chicago
3,-,"Good prices, I only buy fruits veggies and meats, pretty much skip the center of the store."
6,-,Afrench market standby. THE FRENCH MARKET IS A GOOD place to get a varied menu which is generally at least good.  Its been around a while and the vendors chane but you'll always find something to delight you
1,-,Good service but who likes the dealer?
6,-,One of THE WORLDs finest
9,-,"Good prices, good food, good place for lunch! Large parking lot, easy to get to from the interstate. I love the chili, which you can get on anything it seems! Usually has sone decent deals, so you can eat for cheap here!"
3,-,"Wanted a couple of tacos. Told they have a special loaded tacos for $1.00. Sure I'll try them, you have a choice of regular or spicy. I had spicy which I guess was because of the jalapenos on it.  Not bad for a dollar but very sloppy to eat. Make sure to grab a fork and at least 4 napkins. Would I order them again, my answer is no. I'll stick with the regular hard shell tacos."
9,-,"Awesome place! More than just a ""meat shop"", this place is like a small grocery store! They've got anything you'd need for any type or size of cookout, all in one stop! Awesome prepackaged items from other local businesses as well as some national brands. Huge meat selection in the cases, as well as a nicely stocked deli case! BEST LUNCH IN TOWN!!! Their outdoor grill, serves from 11-2 M-Sat, is cheap, FAST, and tastes amazing! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
3,-,Lunch was a double burger and pulled pork sandwich.  Perfect!
1,-,Lots of neat shopping
3,-,"Just a grocery store, I only buy the sale items"
3,-,"It's a dollar general, nothing special."
6,-,"City mall with limited, but specialty shops and good food options"
6,-,"First time to this Cajun New Orleans place. Was initially put off because they didn't have oysters, but made for it with a superior seafood gumbo. The real pleasant surprise was a sampling of four absinthes. All the required trimmings. It was great. Also had boubon, brandy"
7,-,Since the footprint isn't too large you have to go up and down the floors to see everything but the shoe selection is fantastic.
5,-,Good friendly staff
5,-,"I've had good experiences here but something has happened recently under the new owners. I ordered a beer and a shot of bourbon, I was able to sip my bourbon easily because it had to have had at least 20% water in it. That should serve as a warning if you're getting cocktails here."
1,-,Pizzas good. Staff is good
7,-,"Lines can be long, but worth the wait. Tried the beef ribs, pulled pork, tamales, frito pie, with cole slaw, broccoli salad, and spicy pickles. None of the items were amazing, but the beef ribs and frito pie were definite hits and nothing we tried were misses. Prices are a bit high for drinks."
1,-,Who the hell goes to pekin that doesnt have too
7,-,"Beet and goat cheese salad was very nice. Pizza crust is very crispy and has a whole wheat flavor to it. Generally small, definitely need the 16 in even for two people."
3,-,Overall we had a good time. Place is nice but pool tables need recovered as they were dirty from.spilled drinks. I would caution you if you are easily offended it's probably best to not frequent this location. They played loud very sexually explicit music leaving absoutely no doubt  what the musics message is.
7,-,"One of the better beef sandwiches I have had in Chicagoland. Had the combination and the sausage was a standout. Prices are ridiculously low, under $5 for their largest sandwich. Only one flavor of Italian ice, but still very tasty."
2,-,Good dive bar in bucktown. Fantastic beer selection and eclectic vibe. You will have people watching sports and other people on their laptops having a beer.
7,-,"Good, healthy options for breakfast and lunch."
9,-,Great food! Tons of beer and liquor. Right on the river front!
2,-,This place is awesome great games for free with a good beer selection
2,-,Batting practice spot if there's no Cubs game
3,-,"Nice place, quite pricey"
7,-,With Dominick's gone this is now the best place in the West Loop to pick up necessities and any place that has Google Wallet support is cool with me.
3,-,Time for the annual Candle Walk. This is always a great time strolling through the village using low light candles.
6,-,One of three locations. All serve respectable pub food.
1,-,Better than morton
7,-,"Good omelet and skillet dishes. Large portions, ingredients seem high quality, a notch above regular breakfast spots."
4,-,Very restful
8,-,"This is my ""go to"" fun place to take people that are visiting from out of town.  Great beer line up, and tons of fun games."
7,-,"Wanted to check this place out for a while and finally went with a few friends. The space is pretty nice, plenty of seating and you can have a conversation without shouting. Beer selection is good and the bourbon/scotch selection is better than most places. We ordered the jalapeño cheese fries first. There were a few crumbs of pepper and I couldn't find any cheese. Fries were a bit soggy, no indication they are made to order. We then had a pizza that was pretty terrible. Something about the sauce was way off. Making an OK pizza is not that difficult, this was below OK. We did not finish it and did not take the leftovers. Service wasn't awful, but we had to remind the server about our order a few times. If you only go to drink this may be a decent place, but I cannot recommend the food at all."
5,-,"Best food in old Town, friendly staff"
6,-,"A kosher pizza place in the neighborhood.  Alright, but Kosher"
6,-,A reliable stop in the south loop. Always good with an interesting menu
1,-,Customer service was better than Morton
6,-,A classic Chicago stop. Good bar and German food..
6,-,Part of the Navy Pier complex. A good park.
3,-,Met with the actual owner who assited me in my vehicle search. Wow we had a great conversation and I really appreicated him taking his time to just talk. We eventually got around to the vehicle. Highly recommend this dealership.
3,-,"My wife and I stopped in for a pizza one night. They have a great selection service was quick food was tasty, yes we go back again."
7,-,"Decent tapas, the Nigam salad and spinach cigars were standouts."
7,-,"Tried the new brew pub about a week after the grand opening.
Good: Very large selection of Ballast Point brews on tap at good prices and different sizes so you can easily sample. Food was also pretty decent, they did a good job with their take on the Impossible Burger however nachos without cheese is...odd. Definitely going back to try more of the beers.
Not Good: The ordering system is bizarre. They have servers going around, but you have to order and pay at a counter similar to a fast food place, and you can't put in drink orders there (except for soda). You can start a tab and then you have to take further drink orders to the bar. They bring the food out to you and I was asked if I wanted additional drinks later...so they do sort of have table service. Really, really weird."
4,-,Really good food and great service
4,-,Really nice and clean facilities
8,-,"Nice spot.  Tons of TVs.  The briskette was great.  The bartender, Devin was awesome.  I'll be back for more BBQ."
7,-,"Typical Trader Joe's, can get really tight to move around when it's busy."
8,-,"HUGE beer selection, with 100ish beers on draft.  Just had a couple beers, and some truffle fries, which were tasty.  Bartenders were cool.  Decor is really nice."
6,-,"There are many tapas in Chicago,  this one is one of the better and its on the south side below the loop, near cermak.  A complete menu with a good wibe list.  Very big portions for tapas"
7,-,Great pizza. Kind of like Neapolitan style but with a much heartier crust that can support toppings. Really good faro salad as well. Recommended.
3,-,"Wow was this a good tenderloin, not pounded super thin, a buttermilk style batter dredged  in Panko crumbs. Served with fair style fresh cut fries. Flipping delicious! Craft beer samples. Nice place to enjoy a meal."
6,-,A convienant dot kosher restaurant
6,-,"All the wine bars are fairly good, each with its own signature.  This one is among the top"
2,-,Best view in Chicago
7,-,"Good service, crazy noodles and curries are good."
6,-,A good place for a quick bite. Coffee and lunch.
7,-,"Was there for a large party with fixed menu. Food was all done very well, butternut squash ravioli was the highlight. Good service as well."
4,-,They've got what you need
7,-,"Chicken shawarma was ok, meat was a little dry."
3,-,So please come hungry and sit back and enjoy an amazingly delicious breakfast. Food is simply wonderful and the individual portion size your served is really enough for three people to share. Food served in a timely manner and the the servers were all quite nice. This was a very relaxing breakfast. Coffee bar is worth checking out.
1,-,We were told the advertisement we had seen and tried to use wasnt valid how ever it was currently dated in the add
7,-,"Decent price and filling options. Fast food Mediterranean, so not the most authentic, but good for a quick lunch."
6,-,Great hamburgers good bar
9,-,It's schlotzsky's
6,-,"One of the many local playhouses.  They continually have first rate performances and a wide variety of types of play.  It is small and comfortable.  The building is special, designed by jeanie gang. It's perfect for it site"
7,-,"Great contemporary American menu, creative without being avant-garde."
5,-,Best spot in the hood for Kate night beers
6,-,"It is a great donut store, better than dunkin"
3,-,So much history here. This is an all weekend trip which still doesn't provide enough time to really take in all the area has to offer. One of the places we really enjoyed here is the old Blacksmiths Shop where you literally step back in time. The shop has been there since before electricity came to the area. The shop was the first in  Galena to have electricity. The used it to put overhead lights in to help the blacksmiths. Make this one of your destinations when in town. Its located in a bright red building along the waterway.
7,-,Nice location for the indoor farmers market in the winter.
7,-,Impossible burgers take a while since it doesn't seem like many are ordered but they are worth the wait. Good service.
3,-,"Lunch with the wife today, 2 for $20 steak special. Nice lunch, good food at a reasonable price. Seen a comment here about the 2 for $20 price being deceiving (Leland) I don't see it, bill attached."
5,-,Fresh pizza and good prices
6,-,A good old fashioned book store where you get the sense of duration.  Coffee area and events
8,-,Ok beer selection.  Great specials for happy hour (half off apps).
5,-,"Great selection of beers and Whiskey, great food too. Come for wrestling or UFC for a truly amazing experience"
7,-,"Spend the extra few dollars for the steak tacos. Very, very good."
5,-,Ventilation in the theater triggered allergies
7,-,"Great thin crust pizza. Crispy, cracker style with a bit of cornmeal thrown in. Friendly staff."
5,-,Austrian coffees and pastries. All are good thing gs
5,-,Amazing food and friendly staff. Get the wings
5,-,"Best chicken sammich of my life. Don't be embarrassed, you will make noises eating this"
8,-,"This place is great.  Cocktails are fun, and beer line up was cool.  It's a triangle!"
3,-,It was around 8:00pm when we pulled in to get some dinner. Walking in I noticed the place was bright and inviting. Staff greeted us and seating is in a booth in the min dinng area. Several people in here for 8pm. Our waitress Maddie was very pleasant and was very prompt with drink orders and delivery. Food order placed and it didn't seem long at all we were presented with some good looking food dishes placed in front of us. The food was excellent. Thanks to the staff as this was an enjoyable dinner. Please do yourself a favor and stop by and enjoy something from their menu.
4,-,Try if you will
6,-,One of the major Chicago breakfast chains that close by 3 and offer breakfast all day.  Yolk is probably the biggest and it is bright and uplifting with breakfast well done.  Service could be a little better
8,-,"Decent German beer selection, but for some reason I usually prefer Ric's when I'm in Lincoln Square."
1,-,Always very cool
7,-,"Different atmosphere than classic steakhouses in the city, but the steaks hold up with the best."
8,-,"They're making some great beers, and the food is awesome, too.  Excellent burger special on Monday nights."
6,-,"A small noisy trattoria that has a lot of atmosphere. Not for everyone, but a genuine place.  Food is excellent with a good wine list. Spicy mussels we're excellent and grilled trout was well prepared"
6,-,"A great place for everyone. It is kid friendly, safe and above all immaculate.  All the latest in race track set uo, with betting in everyway you can imagine. In additio. It has track feeds fro. Around the country.  The low end food is barely passabe, but it improves from there. Go to the restuarant if you want a r es al meal"
5,-,Try the local stuff
1,-,Worse public transit center I have ever seen
6,-,Typical Filipino food. It was prepared well but it lacked a character
3,-,"I had a cold beer and a Southern Fried Chicken sandwich, Offered with a sald or fries. I opted for salad and was told its a small bowl but coulf be upgraded for an additional $1.49. No problem lets upgrade. Salad served in a larger bowl with a very shallow depth. Appears to be more than it really is. Illusion for sure. Sandwich looked great on menu photo. In person it was highly disappointing. Not a busy night at all so no reason to serve sub par food."
8,-,"Full disclosure, I work around the corner, and go here usually twice a week.  Great beers, great pizza, and great bartenders.  What else do you need?!"
3,-,My preference in Springfield for a quality store. Fresh foods!
3,-,Dining alone as the wife is babysitting. The name is somewhat misleading it is more oriented to Asian Thai food. Food here is prepared fresh upon ordering. Place is on the smaller size very clean with pleasing decor. Staff is friendly and outgoing. I have enjoyed this place on numerous occasions and have never not had a good experience with the dishes I've tried. Delicious.
7,-,"Marcus knows what he is doing and if you are remotely interested in track/fixed/single speeds, this is the place to go.  Repairs and other work is done at very reasonable rates.  They aren't there to try and sell you something, but will be helpful if you ask."
2,-,Tzatziki sauce on 10 million
4,-,Finger licking good
4,-,They always have great merchandise at great prices
6,-,The latest and one of the best in chicago. Gokd choices from known chefs and restaurants. 2 blocks from Politan which is the opposite with less known chefs but equally interesting.  What about all the other spots?
1,-,Every thing about this place is amazing
7,-,Food/drink quality is not worth the prices on the menu.
5,-,Good selection and staff
7,-,"Great bar and restaurant. Selection of beers brewed on premise far outnumber what you can get in stores so it is an awesome place to try out brews you can't get elsewhere. Had a brunch special and salad, both were excellent. Will definitely go back. Only slight downside was glasses that were available for sale are quite pricey."
6,-,"If I was 30 years younger, what a great spot for an assignation.   Strong hard liquor, limited beer and wine, and light food. Spectacular mood lighting in an already dark space. WHAT A COMBO. if your uner 40 get over there."
8,-,"Beer line up is just ok.  The bartender was cool.  This is just a weird spot to have as a venue.  The ""stage"" kind of wraps around the front and side of the place.  Right when you walk in the door, BOOM, there's a loud band playing right in your face!!"
5,-,Amazing food and I didn't feel gross after eating a Torta
8,-,"Fantastic cocktails.  I've never had the food, but it the menu sounds good.  The bar staff is always killer.  Great beer list."
7,-,"Tried the spicy tan tan men noodles. They were a bit firmer than I expected, but still a cut above most noodle places. Broth and pork were both excellent. Gyoza was good, and the black sesame ice cream was a nice finish."
3,-,Nice small downtown bar. Very crowded in here. Popular place I guess. I had fun.
3,-,Had to stop in for some frozen dog food.
2,-,Kinda small but good Bavarian options
3,-,Cool place but due to Covid didn't go inside.next trip hopefully.
1,-,Bartender tonight was in ready rude for just opening back up . Patrons are cool.
3,-,Let me say first off this place is awesome! I spent for 6:30pm-9:00pm in both buildings. All ya need is quarters and the night is good. So many choices of machines both current style and retro. It is so worth the time to take a few hours to stop here and enjoy yourself. It's really a no pressure kind of day. Have fun all.
6,-,A complete knife shop.  A wide range of styles and types. Plus quick knife sharpening and other services.  A small assortment of other kitchen items
2,-,"This place is awesome, very authentic. The patio is very chill, they have a garden next door they bring in the herbs and veggies from!"
6,-,an old world bakery with a typical assortment of baked goods. the coffee shop is very good. i recommend it when in the area
7,-,Fun when closed off for the annual micro brew fest.
6,-,An intriguing place. Very cozy and strange. Average coffees
7,-,"I have only had the bahn might sandwiches and tacos, but they are sublime. Fillings are creative and match vegetables very well with the grilled meats."
1,-,Best dominoes I have ever dealt with
2,-,Good vibe inside the aloft hotel. La colombe nitro coffee on tap and other great coffee choices. Breakfast menu is simple but everything is solid.
6,-,"Great concept with a food market, a coffee bar and a regular restaurant.  I have spent time in all three on different visits.  The coffee bar is good with choices. The restaurant is good, but not as special of the choices in the neigherhood."
2,-,"Nice place for healthy Greek food then you can move onto the bar next door which feels like a night club, cool vibe."
4,-,Great place to have a good time
4,-,Good times
4,-,Great prices

1,-,Great service bad quality
3,-,"Light dinner tonight. Just a bowl of tomato soup, which was pretty good."

7,-,"If you are looking for a place that has deep dish slices, this is one of the best."
4,-,It was simply a beautiful day despite the rain
7,-,No waiting at this medium sized Japanese restaurant on a Wednesday. The specialty is the ramen and we tried the tonkatsu and spicy garlic. The tonkatsu broth was excellent. Rich and flavorful. Portions are not as large as some other places but still plenty. The kimchi spring rolls are also really tasty.
1,-,Very nice staff very neat place
3,-,"Yep, please keep this amazing place a secret. It's very small and has limited seating. Each order cooked in the order its received, slow and freshly made.  Burgers are definitely their signature items with handmade milkshakes and malts coming in a strong second. So now you know to keep quiet so the lo g lines are avoided."
6,-,A good but not great shellfish restaurant.  Good happy hour daily
5,-,Every bad rumor you've heard about here is true.
7,-,Great service and a really nice outdoor patio.

7,-,Outrageous drink prices. Not remotely commensurate with the service or atmosphere.
4,-,The food was great as always
7,-,Cool space on the 3rd floor of the Renaissance Hotel. Food and service were fine - the whole 'twist on bar food' by making things more expensive and adding one or two new ingredients isn't that creative. They cram way too many people into the space.

3,-,"Good stuff ,just had the tacos"
3,-,"Beer was good, hamburger was overcooked. Today is Sunday and I think they served it on last mondays bun. Mine was very dry, hard and stale. Tacos not bad at all. Cheddar mashed potatoes pretty good. Why do ya ask how you want your burger cooked if you not going to pay attention.
White Castle does it better without trying"

I can't wait until they stop stocking my Bundaburg ginger beer."

There are now hotels, restaurants and even a  12000 seat arena complex.  It's going to continue growing to the south to IIT and to West to the river.

3,-,"Dairy Queen.....11-20-2020
Hey let's put the minimal amount of product in the lid and we use the base of the container for a lid. People will never realize we can charge more for less. If the container is used properly you would get more ice cream and room for toppings. Whip cream fits into the rounded section and the DQ curl protected in the small dome. Thoughts?"
7,-,"Facility is absolutely enormous. Enjoyed a show there, sight lines and seating are good, no bad seats for the 300 or so that can fit in there. The in house wines ranged from average to pretty bad. Recommend ordering other options."
2,-,Nice beer selection with same concept as tapster board games and weekly events

5,-,Plenty of TV's and decent beer selection

5,-,Amazing craftsmanship and sound
3,-,"It was an awesome historic place, sadly it burned 4-02-20."
7,-,"Pretty typical Thai menu, nothing particularly authentic or 'off the menu'. Their special Hot Woks noodles is linguine with chicken and a few shrimp. Nothing marked spicy is actually spicy without adding a lot of chili sauce. The tom yum soup is pretty decent. Did not try any sushi."
7,-,Small location but you can get high quality groceries and produce like any other WF.
1,-,Not friendly at all
8,-,"Great german beer line up.  Cool German beer hall lay out.  Didn't eat this time, but I'll be back for a giant pretzel."
2,-,"Awesome beer selection, very diverse food menu. Good sports bar."
7,-,"Extremely underwhelming for the price. The only decent sashimi was the chutoro. Short rib and mushroom skewers were good, but nothing else was impressive or flavorful. Service was fine, but at that price hard to justify. Will not go back."
5,-,Good college bar during the season
6,-,Dissappointing
4,-,A beautiful place
4,-,The big and toasty was big and good this morning
7,-,"First Chicago location for the East Coast salad chain. Similar to a Chipotle style assembly where your salad is made and handed off to a few different people for different ingredients/toppings. All the items I saw are fresh and appear to be high quality. Lots of options for customizing. The last stage was interesting, they dump out all the ingredients onto a cutting board and chop up everything even though most of the toppings are already diced. Prices seem fair for downtown, most are in the $8-9 range and it is a decent sized serving. Staff was very friendly, will go back for sure."
6,-,"A nice spot for walking, Frank Lloyd Wright homes, a coffee or a meal and good shopping at primarily local stores. Easy to get to by pubic transportation"
5,-,Diner good hearty food that'll leave you satisfied

7,-,"The huaraches and sabor tacos use homemade tortillas, highly recommended."
7,-,"This place is definitely out of the way, sw corner of the loop amongst nondescript buildings. Dark bar up front and a small, but nice outdoor seating area in the back. Good selection of beer for a neighborhood bar, just added 3Floyds recently. Had a burger that was done perfectly - asked for medium and it was medium. Fries and cole slaw are good for sides."
5,-,The order taking during previews was annoying. Overoriced
8,-,I usually find better stuff at Marshall's and Burlington.
3,-,Reservations here with a group of friends. Place was busy upon arrival and we were seated right away. Most ordered the pasta special a choice of 4 different pastas with salad for $8.50. I had a medium special pizza @ $9.49. Food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and the dishes served looked good. I noticed the pizza had a perfectly round crust just a bit over thin crust. I'm guessing pre made crust. Taking a slice of pizza I noticed right away they used imitation mozzarella cheese as it did not string as pulled away like real mozzarella cheese does. Overall the pizza was actually pretty good. Prices for what was served were reasonable. Yes I would recommend.
7,-,"Good sandwiches. Portion is large without being over the top huge. House chips are fine, there is no other side option anyway."
4,-,Great place to hang out

3,-,They have something for everyone.
3,-,Great place to stop for a great lunch or quick refreshments. Sandwiches totally delicious and fresh.

A short time later all the food was delivered. Everyone's order looked good and was correct. Now the negative is the waitress was not good at bringing coffee refills to us. It was a good breakfast overall and nice catching up with friends. Pictured is the Santafe skillet."
9,-,"Good little hole in the wall spot. Decent bar food, good prices, and parking in the rear!!!"
6,-,"A good regional art and furniture auction house. They have regular events about 20 per year.  Go to an auction, maybe even bid.  One step removed from the big internationals such as Sothebys"
3,-,How can your go wrong with Donuts and coffee at 8:25pm. Ya can't.
1,-,Expensive but better than wallmart
6,-,Alright. Not as good as downtown
6,-,A great place to have a cocktail in the lobby
3,-,Never ever leave here with a to-go order without checking to ensure ya have something to eat it with. Can't believe they wouldn't make sure the at least put a fork in the bag. Food is excellent!
7,-,"Like all cell phone places this can be an exercise in frustration. Employees often don't have basic info that you can get online and will push accessories whether you want/need them or not. I like T-Mobile, just avoid going into the stores if possible."

3,-,"Very clean appearance, staff is outgoing and friendly. Food delivered promptly. Food very tasty, will be back for sure."
6,-,The seats were more remembered than the event.  Either make it passably comfortable or tear it down. I'm not going back regardless of the show
6,-,"Good for a dinner before the symphony.  Good, but not great food."
4,-,Good for the hood
6,-,"A special gastropub focused on origional foods such az mussels and frites, duck ruebeb and a comllete menu of the same style.  Pkace has its own vibe as a bar and a meetup joint.  The beer selection is complete including the glasses by brand and style.  Very origional. One of the places the define the chicago experience"
3,-,"A small family owned shop located on the square in Petersburg. We normally order one of the thin custs pizzas which are quite good. We have tried the deep dish here however it's is not a deep dish pizza, it's just a thicker crust."
7,-,"Portions are extremely large, so you get your money's worth. Food is not rave worthy, but solid and consistent."
3,-,Just jumped in for a few items for dinner.

3,-,My wife and I enjoyed  a very good meal here. Food hot and tasty. Had more than enough that we both took home the leftovers.  Stoo in and enjoy.
1,-,Ghetto!
6,-,"A magnificent site with a true Gibson's restaurant.  Known for it's social status it won't disappoint me it's trendy, touristy and the place to be seen. The food is reliability good but not great. My friend had to gave beef because it was Gibson's. The Italian part is a bit of a misnomer, in that the Italian dishes aren't really the stars. Rigatoni with sausage And voddka sauces was good, but not the best. Meatballs we're good but not supreme. Go there because it is beautiful and Gibson's not for an Italian meal."
7,-,"Good slices, crust has a nice chewy consistency but still a decent crispy bottom. Very, very similar to Boiler Room's style."
1,-,Great food great servers
7,-,Good bowl and wrap options.
3,-,"1st time here, nice place inviting and looks like a good place to watch sporting events. Plenty of TV's at all angles so all should have good views of a game. So let's get to the waitress Brittney, she was absolutely great and quite pleasant to talk with. Great service. Then we ordered drinks and looked at the menu. So I'm being quite honest here this menu couldn't have been more basic. It's a one page with appetizers, salads, a very small selection of sandwiches and then about 5 different dessert options. Scanning the menu I have to say I was quite bored as nothing seemed to stand out as interesting or unique. Both of us commented on the lack of interest this menu presented to us. We made a simple order. So the service was good, the food arrival time was good. I had the BLT and she had the Beet Salad. Neither of us were impressed. Truthfully it's just adequate an both of us thought it's not worth a return trip."
5,-,Closed. I'll miss it so. Easily top 3 coffee shops in Chixago
6,-,"A great little spot that has three advantages you buy it by the slice however big or small and they weigh it, you can get an assortment, you dont wind up carrying a box all over the city. They have about twenty choices i had arriabiatta, tomato and basi and gorganzola and leek. The style is roman and it a little doughy in the middle and crusty on the bottom.  It is definitely a keeper"
3,-,Awesome! Fresh baked pastries and breads. Seated in the dinning room and was greeted by staff. Drink order placed and promptly served. Food selection was very nice upscale type dishes. Order placed and promptly served. Look a d tasted fantastic.

6,-,A nice change from the other chains.  More limited menu but good coffee.
3,-,Ok store. Read this book printed in 2002. Relates to current events today. Scary they new about this back then.
6,-,First visit so first impressions. A great spot both location and the room. Nice bar area with typical seating plus comfortable chusioned chairs which make you want to stay.  The back continues the plush scene and allows you a little privacy.  The wine was excellent with flights that had many choices including 2 white and two red.  The food was what i dont know about. It was free but the croquet monsior was poor. Will definitely go again and try a cheese and salami plate.  Does offer retail
4,-,It was a beautiful place
6,-,"The Harry Carey's, don't try another one for the food.  A GREAT steaks, chops and Italian place"
3,-,"Christmas shopping, lots of great gift ideas."
6,-,"A complex of shops, restaurants and housing that provides a self contained community in the clyborne corridor. Probably the biggest gain is relatively high density living.  Perfect for millennials."
2,-,"Unorganized, no cold brew coffee. Need more workers. Has major potential though"

6,-,A good coffee shop.
3,-,Had the build a burger option with a side of augratin potatos. Burger was way overcooked.
8,-,"Good beer line up.  Great burgers.  The only bummers are that it's on the smaller side, and the kitchen is open to the dining room, so sometimes you leave this place smelling like a burger.  Warning:  They play LOUD METAL."
7,-,Good turkey sandwiches.
4,-,Enjoyed as usual
3,-,"Stopped in to grab a take and bake pizza. They had two specials a vegetable or meat lovers. They let me do half and half, perfect for the wife and I. Pizza is thin crust baked on the tray it's made on. It was excellent."
4,-,The food was great and fast for lunch time
3,-,What's not to like about being in a park enjoying a beautiful day.
3,-,"I understand  its a fairly new place and I hope they get thing under control soon. I have to honestly say I wouldn't eat here again. I ordered the rib tips and wow, they were way to salty. Even putting the BBQ sauces didn't help. I would much rather drive to Dwight, IL and eat at Cherry 🍒 Roasters BBQ.  Sad because I was excited to see them open,  that changed as soon as I tatsed the food. Sorry, but just being honest."
7,-,"Good thin crust, but not quite on par with some of the tavern style cracker crusts at a few places in the city."
3,-,"This place is phenomenal,  great equipment, well organized,  staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. Has a nice selection of fitness clothing and supplements available.  One of the best gyms I've visited. Highly recommended if your looking for a high quality gym."
6,-,"Very good. The advantages of Chicago Restaurant Week, when you get to try restaurants more abundantly and relatively less expensive.  The menu is about german food preoared with alittle twist. The pork chacuterie was stupendous. Spaetzle was excellent. Schnitzel was crispy and tender.   Will ve back"
9,-,"Cool spot, huge bar, tons of seating! Cool spot downtown."
5,-,Best lunch spot for the money
7,-,"Food was OK, nothing special. Had the tamales, plenty large portion, but were too salty. Chips and salsa/guacamole were fine, nothing really stood out. Did not have any if the notoriously strong margaritas."
4,-,They treated me right on my birthday
3,-,Ggetting fuel & a lottery ticket.

6,-,Neat little stand with outdoor seating and fabulous ice cream and gelato
6,-,An excellent place for higher tier Mexican. Went for brunch and it didnt disappoint
7,-,"Good prices, but the pizza is average. Consistent with other Barnaby's, but not the best thin crust available."
3,-,"1st time here, nice place in downtown Springfield. Staff very friendly. They had a casual side with a few booths and a walk up counter for carry outs. Then the next room is a nice dinning area. 1st impression is good. Seated and given menus, drink orders placed. Menu is nice with the main options being pasta dishes or what appears to be nice hand tossed pizzas. Orders placed, food received. My thoughts as they brought out the salad was they put a lot into a small bowl. The main course looked and tasted really good. As a side note the portion sizes are probably what you should be receiving, a regular size (not large) serving. Food & service was great but not nearly as good as the cannoli cake. Definitely give this place a try."
5,-,"Great food and staff. Ask for Jess, she's a great server"
3,-,"Just stopped for coffee, very good."
7,-,"Selection was fine, but prices were not competitive with other grocery store options."

7,-,Cool karaoke bar stuck in time.
7,-,Good service and ingredients seem to be quality but the end result is not that great.

6,-,"Atypical in city mall, limited in size but convienant.  PLENTY of shopping in immediate area"
6,-,"An interesting touristy coffee, pastry, sandwich shop that has good products"
3,-,"It's McDonald's, can't go wrong with the egg McMuffin"

6,-,"Good for Starbucks. Good room, the latest in prepared food options and good views"
1,-,Had a blast .
3,-,"Quite favorful, however the soup had to be sent back as it was not hot. If not for that would have been a 4 star lunch.

7-27-17
Dinner with mom and wife. I had the sirloin garlic butter steak ordered medium rare. With mashed redskin potatoes and broccoli.  Potatoes good, broccoli was cooked to the point where it still has some crunch (good) however the steak was very thin and completely overcooked to almost medium well (No pink). Its about 5:00pm and in our section there was only one other table with four people. No reason at all to overcook a steak."
4,-,The last place to get liquor before you get to the casino
6,-,"A genuinely good Chinese restaurant, that gets little  press but deserves it. I am constantly looking for its mention in top 20 lists, where it clearly belongs. Dishes are made with flair and style. Has added an interesting concept Bento box, a mix of 4 or 5 small portions for a very reasonable price.  Very attractive  space.  Took 3 others, who are very picky, and they had a great time. Go"
8,-,"They had what I was looking for and the young lady working there was nice, but the computer was malfunctioning, so I wasn't able to use my Game stop points.  This means I paid more than I should have."

8,-,I like this place a lot.  Nicest dive bar ever!

3,-,Stopped in to pick up a picture frame. Nice place great staff.
8,-,"Beer line up isn't very good, but the food's ok.  Why does it have to be so loud in there?  Even if they have a game on, the volume is so jacked everyone has to yell!  Most of the staff is ok, but once one I was there the bartender was HAMMERED."
7,-,"Good thin crust, Neapolitan style pizza. A little more chewy than Coalfire for example, but definitely worth checking out."

7,-,"Awesome selection, best inventory in the city."
7,-,Good gelato and creative flavors.
5,-,Great drinks and food. Staff is well trained and friendly
3,-,Outdoor space for concerts is way too small. People are crowded into a small space between the building and a parking ramp. Whoever thought this was a good idea should be replaced.

3,-,"First I have to tell you I absolutely love think crust pizza. Do this is our first trip with another couple to eat at the Handlebar.

The food isnt rave worthy, but it's better than most gastropubs and a wide selection. The wine is very good with tasting if your trying out. A very wide selection of types by Coopers Hawk and some that arnt. Very reasonably priced particularly by the glass. Everything is available either takeout or at the retail stores.The seatiareas are very attractive.  A lot of TLC went into this flagship  membership options are very reasonable"

There are enough Italian restaurants in chicago that this one out not to exist. 200 dollars for lunch when the salad was no better than fast food, the carbonara was bland and they had to asked for parmesan and the meatballs were average by vapanios standards.

7,-,"Good selection of cuisine and drinks. Logistics can be tough when crowded to find a seat or get by people in line. Overall pretty good, but the biggest issue is how loud it is. Very difficult to have a normal conversation. It's not a club, the music doesn't add anything, I don't get it."

7,-,"*Note that this is for the lunch spot at 55 E. Adams in the Forum dining hall*.
Hard to tell that I was eating tacos. Extremely sloppy presentation, just a mess of meat and sauce(?) on two not very good store bought tortillas. Very small and not flavorful at all. The salsa with the chips was awful. Would rather get virtually any off the shelf brand than whatever they made or bought. The only thing that wasn't bad were the chips which they thankfully didn't make."
4,-,It was a in and out process with no problems

7,-,"Good selection of wine and beer. More convenient than heading to grocery stores on Halsted. Have not tried out bar yet, but looks like a good place to get a drink and relax. Wines on the shelves need more organization."
6,-,"A great spot by rick bayless.  You can eat at one his restaurants every day and never be bored. This one is eithger a bar hangout or a quick snack or meal. I am partial to the oxacan tlucuda, but every thing is good along with a sampling of one of the 12 or so fresh beers made by them"

6,-,OK sandwich and coffee shop. Good for a change up.
4,-,The kings table was outstanding
8,-,"The food is decent, but they charge too much.  I think 5 bucks for a chili dog is a little ridiculous.  Especially when you have a Taco Bell right next door, where you can get a whole box of garbage food AND a drink for 5 bucks."

5,-,Very nice venue for concerts

4,-,They have my dream car in the window
3,-,Just stopped in here for a quick bite to eat. I ordered the Chipotle TecMex bowl with shrimp. It was outstanding and full of flavor. Perfect portion size for lunch. Waiter Noah was friendly and prompt with the food order. Think I need to stop in again and try this in either their chicken or prime rib version.

Started with a few vegetable dishes, green beans and summer squash / corn with pine nuts. Both were very salty, to the point where we ordered plain noodles to go with them (rice wold have been better). Both dishes were good ideas, but execution was lacking if that much salt is needed for flavor. The beef slap noodles however were very good. Thick noodles with a great consistency and very tender meat falling apart like a pot roast. Easily the highlight of the night."
3,-,"Easy in, grab some food and get out. Great store."

3,-,Quick trip in to pick up some missing thanksgiving items.
7,-,"New ramen shop in the West Loop competing with 3 other spots in a small area. The space and atmosphere are cool. Dumplings are tasty, two styles available, one pan fried and one steamed, reminiscent of dim sum. Had high hopes for the ramen but it was just ok. Chashu was not very tender. Egg was a bit overcooked. Noodles were fine, good if you prefer thinner, crinkly style. Broth was tasty, not overly rich."

3,-,1st time here and purchased a couple bakery pastries to go. Well an hour later I ate one of the almond bars and was like oh my God. I'm just saying if I would have tried it when I walked outside I would have turned around and went right back in and bought their entire tray if these. Absolutely delicious.
3,-,"I stopped here with my family after a day of shopping in St. Louis, MO. We were picking up some bakery treats. Great selection even for this time of night, around 5:30pm. Took a few minutes for the four of us to decide and make our selection. Sales person really nice and I have to say somewhat truthful (haha) when I asked about the coffee. He said I don't like it but some people do. Well he was right. It was like drinking hot water with a touch of weak coffee. Not good since I like a cup of good bold coffee."
7,-,Nice selection of premade meals and ingredients for Indian cuisine.
5,-,"My office ordered lunch from here. First half the order showed up, secondly the food that did arrive was cold, and the 2nd half of the order my boss had to pick up was also like a Foreigner song(the band) Cold as Ice. The quality is something we weren't willing to sacrifice. I'd encourage those in charge of this place to view this not as a negative review but an immense opportunity to right the situation both for myself and my coworkers and those who order in the future."
5,-,Cures hangovers and fills you up to induce naps
5,-,Growing pains. I've had them try charging me for dinner prices for lunch items and the other time they just opened and couldn't serve food for an hour to change their oil. Not winning me over

3,-,"Dimly lit dining room, quiet atmosphere. Relaxing and good food."
6,-,"When you see suspensions of chili oil in your halachic you picture too hot for the fish... no, it was perfect along with the other flavors. A simple cornbread Madeline was brought to perfection by the spread. The as only the beginning. Everyone of seven dishes were brought to culinary delight by the spices along with the fresh ingredients.  The wine selection was inventive and the desert and coffee exceptional.   All at a reasonable price. This is among the top five restaurants in Chicago"
7,-,"Quiet, cozy bar to grab a drink at."
1,-,Best after bar food ever
6,-,Understaffed for a major outlet on Michigan Ave.
8,-,My first biryani experience.  I was underwhelmed.
3,-,Just picking up a few essentials

3,-,"Seems Marriott no longer has me in the system as a customer,  sad. However they did have a room available with a queen bed. Good enough, reserved it keep on with my tasks at hand. An hour and a half later I arrived at the Fairfield Inn. First appearance it's a nice place. Greeted by the management when I arrive. Reservation check-in went very smoothly, given a room on the second floor, far corner of the hotel. I have to say the hotel room is very small with queen size bed in it. Don't know if it's because of the location it was. Didn't matter I was tired, comfortable bed and slept well.  we did a very quick breakfast buffet in the morning and left the hotel, overall it was a nice experience. Still don't know how Marriott lost my customer info, they probably would prefer I stay elsewhere."

6,-,"Ave starbucks, there is better"
6,-,"Fisk and company was a bit of a disappointment. The mussels where ok, but not special. It doesnt come with frites instead you have tp pay for them extra. I asked the waiter for one or two to sample  rather than buy.  He told me the order was small, for 7 bucks?  He conveniently forgot all about the sample. A bad move for a new restaurant in my neighborhood.   I dont know wether ill go back and it is two blicks from my apartment"

5,-,Nice staff
3,-,"Very good breakfast,  homemade foods! If you want something different this is the place to try."
1,-,Young bartender was incredibly friendly and let us in early
6,-,Pretty good burger because of toppings.  An egg bacon jalapenos lettuce tomato insures every bite has at least two or three flavors. Slw because of Covid.  The reviews have to take into consideration how the restaurants are dealing with covid. I am happy their trying
6,-,Great and beautiful park with plenty of activities
6,-,What can I say.  Don't get a cheekbones get a stack sandwich instead
3,-,"Not a good choice of places to visit tonight with a group of 12. Waitress (young blond) was terrible, seemed like she was uninterested. A couple of requests for butter went unfilled. Drinks requested twice  which were never delivered. Can't say anything about the steaks as you cooked them yourself (fun to do with friends) salad bar, well it wasn't to bad. Employees did not seem friendly at all. Too bad It's not a bad place.
Updated 10-10-17. I received a call from Steve Shaw with Alexander's corporate office. We had a nice conversation about my experience that night. He was apologetic and sincere about correcting the issues I addressed. He informed me topic has been addressed with staff. Steve said he wants customers to have a positive experience while dining with Alexander's.  He offered a gift card to which I declined the offer explaining the conversation was enough knowing this was discussed with staff. Yes we will return as the food is very good. Hopefully  it was just an off night for staff. Thanks for the personal phone call Steve, shows your drive to produce a quailty experience."

3,-,"Our 1st time here. Arrived at 5:46pm according to the time stamp on my 1st photo. Place is attached to a old church but amole dining area in a comfortable setting. We were seated within a reasonable amount of time. Waitress came over for drink orders. She told us not to drink the water and suggested bottled water because of Carlinville's water quality. Sure that's fine, we'll have 3 bottles. Total of 8 tables that had people at them with still ample room for numerous guests. Looking around I noticed we were the only ones drinking bottled water everyone else has glasses of water. Maybe they needed to boost profits. So our order was placed and we waited and waited and waited and waited some more. Food seems to be coming out of the kitchen very very slowly. Anyway at 6:39pm after almost an hour our food arrived. Wife's food was cold. My burger order medium was cooked well done. Not impressed at all. No need to complain to them, I paid and have zero desire to ever return. Hopefully they get things together becuase this was a complete failure."

2,-,Cool basement with decent music
7,-,"Easily some of the best BBQ in Chicago. Tomato salad was fresh and obviously high quality produce was used. Cornbread was excellent, not dry at all. St. Louis style ribs were deserving of 5 stars. The only point off is for the brisket which was relatively average. Avoid that and stick with the ribs."
3,-,"Very nice place, sits on top of a hill overlooking the town below. Give them a try. Good food."

Ordered the Pork Tenderloin (lunch price$5.00) and a side of hand battered mushrooms $3.50. Thought the prices were very reasonable for what you get for your money. Enjoyed a Shiner Bock beer while waiting for the food. Service was good and food came out freshly made and hot in a reasonable amount of time. Overall it was a very good lunch.
6,-,"A landmark, but resting on its laurels. Tried again and never again. The soup was lukewarm the potato pancake was cold and had no potatoes the Reuben was premade just add the pastrami,  which was good, but the sandwich was cold. There are much better delis at the same price point."

3,-,Stopped for fuel and restroom break. Very nice and it's quite clean. Impressed.

8,-,"This place is right across the street from my apartment, so I've been here quite a few times.

7,-,Awesome biryani. Chili chicken is really tasty. Do not go for ambiance.

5,-,Good variety of flavors in their food. Great wine and beer selection too
6,-,"A value. Not exactly a trendy spot, it once was, but a good value with reliable italian food. Go"

2,-,Had the haloumi and avocado starters which were the best part. Quinoa salad and Chicago style euro was just meh.
9,-,"This place is great! Right on the water front, plenty of parking for cars and motorcycles. Near a public boat ramp, with a large dock to be able to park at to get to the bar off the river. Very friendly staff, good prices."

3,-,"It's fairly new so maybe change is coming. Needed fuel and a bite to eat so stopped in here because it recently opened. My mistake, the premium fuel here was $3.15. That's higher than I usually pay which is around $2.79. so let's go in and get something to eat. Bought 2 slices of pizza, bottle of soda and some licorice. Pay attention close because the prices they rang up were NOT the price listed on the labels. So after some show and tell with the clerk prices were corrected. So get into the car and off I go back to the interstate. Pizza smelled good however was frikin hard and very crispy. Apparently must have been on the heating rack for quite some time.

The wine sel ection is good for the limited menu.  All that you want to pair is well represented.  The only problem is you cant get in.  Wait is 6 to 8 weeks.  BEST BET IS A WEEKEND LUNCH.  Max wait is 30 minutes, well worth it.  Early dinner 5 to 530 also a possibilty"
2,-,"Easy on the margaritas, they’ll get ya"
3,-,During this covid-19 crisis it's nice to get away and enjoy the beauty of a local park. There were numerous people there however it was obvious that the social distancing was definitely considered. A lot of people fishing and there was a good distance between everyone. People walking the park stay quite a distance behind the other folks. Great day just to walk around get some fresh air and be part of nature. If you're in the area please stop by and enjoy this.
2,-,Very similar to wicker park location but always a good vibe here. Pizza is delicious and so are the cocktails. Patio area is huge but usually packed

7,-,"Went here based on all the positive reviews. Tiger Cry is good, but not the standout in was expecting from all the mentions. Papaya salad was a tasty appetizer alternative. Tried peanut lover and Penang curry for the entrees. The sauces they make are clearly richer and note flavorful than a lot of Thai places, that was the biggest difference I noticed. It is BYOB - go just north for a good selection."
3,-,"This used to be a great place to go. The last few times we have been there have not been good experiences. Lost food orders, wrong dishes served, overcooked chicken, light staff servers and kitchen makes for a long wait. Bartender extremely slow and the bar us not busy. He forgets orders, happened last night with our group of 7. Saw the waitress give him the drink order. Both the waitress and bartender forgot the order ands had to be reminded. Think we are all done with this place. Additionally the place is up for sale so possibly they no lo get have the interest in retaining customers. 4 of us had the fried chicken which was very dry."
7,-,"Food was good, but not great. Had the 4 course bento box as offered on gdine. The pork + chicken adobo was ok, sauce was too heavy and sweet. One of the other options in the box, NY strip, was much better. There was a mix up with the gdine reservation which was partially our fault, but the staff did not understand the restrictions and ended up charging us full price. It took several conversations with the manager before he honored the lunch special. Very nice atmosphere and dining experience, but prices still seem high for the food quality."

3,-,Plain old good home style food.
8,-,"The tenders were great.  I had the medium, which had a nice little kick to it.  I'll probably try the hot next time.  I liked the potato salad better than the coleslaw.  The bartender was great, but they serve the beer in plastic cups.  They should get some proper glassware."
6,-,"A famous ol place which pleases the crowd, and it is crowded.  If your a regular it gets a little old, and its not special. But if your from out of town or gave guests its a special place"
3,-,Very clean store with easy to find items. Just stopped in for some fruit.

3,-,"Amazing fun filled afternoon of German food, treats and shopping."
6,-,"All right, nothing special. An American gastro pub"
6,-,"The latest thing is specialty Musuems which have an interactive and small room feel. Two in Chicago,  the wndr and nevermore.  They are great, but unless you have different guests I'm imaging the experience doent change. Definitly go and you will find it special for all ages."
3,-,Ordered two steak dinners to take home due to the current situation. Drove 15 miles home and opened the sack. The aroma was killer on the drive. Dug into a excellent meal salad crisp and fresh and the ribeye was still hit and cooked to a just right medium rare.  Well done to the entire staff. What a great experience.

4,-,Good food and good fun always
7,-,"Solid bridge, did not fall into the river."

2,-,"Stopped in for a beer with friends, good vibe. Must try the pizza on my next visit!"

2,-,A unique mix of happy camper and homeslice in the heart of wicker park. Great pizza selection with awesome cocktails. The addition of another pizza place is warmly welcomed to maybe just maybe be just as good as piece brewery right next door.
3,-,"Walking in the door ya get a sample of fresh caramel corn. Then you see shelves and more shelves and then barrels of popcorn. Then it hits ya...there is a tall gentleman behind the counter trying to coax and entice ya into spending all your hard earned money on popcorn. I'm pretty sure he had to have sold cars at one time. Well doesn't matter how many customers he harassed people including me were emptying there life savings just to buy some of this amazing popcorn. I walked out with the Hot Cinnamon flavor. Side note they didn't sell plain popcorn. The guy yells at my wife saying you would go to Baskin Robbins and buy Vanilla. Boy was he ever wrong, that's exactly what she would buy!"

7,-,"One of the better steaks in the city, had to return one that was overcooked, but overall a very good experience."
7,-,"One of the few places that makes cazuelitas. Ceramic crock with cheese and meat or veggies. Served with homemade corn tortillas you make your own tacos. Must try. Micheladas were tasty as well. Overall, a cool taqueria hidden away on Ashland and Monroe."
2,-,Ricotta Pillows for the win
3,-,Can someone please explain how anyone can walk into the store and make it outside again without making a purchase. Yes I melted a credit card here. Bit it was worth it to make someone happy.
4,-,"What beautiful cars they have, wish I had one"
8,-,"The chicken fingers were fantastic.  If you like fried chicken, you have to try this place.  I think they're breading the chicken with magic.  I wasn't as much a fan of the spaghetti.  The sauce is too sweet for me.  The other must try is what they call ""Fiesta Noodles"".  It's the fast food version of a Filipino dish called Polabok, and it's delicious."
3,-,"Very rude, left without making a purchase."
6,-,An architecture must see and in Chicago a free event every night in the summer
8,-,Decent beer list.  This place has to have the best happy hour in the city.  $2.50 for EVERYTHING!!!

3,-,Met a group of people here tonight.we we're seated in the game room which gave us plenty of room. Had a bowl of their tavern chilli which was quite good. Have to come back another time and enjoy a meal. Food that was brought out to our table looked really good for bar food. People in the group all said food was good.
7,-,Really great outdoor space. Tried a variety of dishes and everything was good. They are very strict with seating and masks which was helpful.
1,-,Little expensive but cool
3,-,"First time walking through the doors.  You are immediately looking at glass that is at least eye level with various cupcakes behind the glasd sitting on small pedestals. The appearance of the cupcakes looks professionally decorated with a mound of icing. The young sales girl inquires, is this your first time. Yes. Well all cupcakes are.$3.75 each. I guess they want you to adjust quickly to the high prices. Anyway we each choose our cupcake and ordered a coffee. Price at the register was $9.75 without a thank you for your order. As for the Cupcake it was moist, flavorful and had way too much icing for me. Icing was super sweet. Overall I'm sure others will enjoy this place. Me probaly not,  I'm really not a cake person so I don't see myself returning."
5,-,Good brunch stop. Great drink and food selection

2,-,Burritos here have cured many a hangover
5,-,Staff was pretty inept
6,-,It is one of the different type of steakhouses.  French style with anerican cuts. It has a great assortment of interesting and artinal appetizers and sides. They also have a great kunch special and the sell cuts of meat retail.  The meak had an important miss in too salty beef tartare and the seating is a bit to crowded. Still i would try it again.  The winner  short rib beignets
9,-,It's family video
4,-,Everything you need for beauty
6,-,"Typical Barnes and Noble, but getting harder to find"
7,-,Now that it's finished it's a great place to walk and view the skyline from a totally different perspective.
1,-,Got a bunch of money?
1,-,Nice dive but super busy on weekends.
3,-,Went there for one specific items which clearly said 20% that item. Nope rang up regular and wouod not discount it. I went backntook a photo of the sign and explained this sign is clearly 20% off. Send someone over to validate it and please apply the correct discount. These two ladies weren't happy about it but did apply the 20% to our purchase. As we walked off one told the other to go remove the sign. Buyer beware.
7,-,"Tried this relatively new place in the nw corner of the Loop. Clean, well lit environment. Staff is very friendly. Small, easy to understand menu. The pockets(?) are pretty good, obviously freshly made in front of customers. Ingredients are good and veggies are still crisp after cooking the dough. I wouldn't suggest eating on the go, the bottom was a bit soggy and ended up falling apart."
1,-,Better than Morton
7,-,"Cool space. Very nice sake selection. Seems like more of a place to grab drinks, the food was ok, not commensurate with the prices. The short ribs were a standout however."

Also a great place for gifts."
8,-,One of my favorite beer bars in the city.  Try the Bomb Sandwich.  It's a meat lover's dream!
7,-,"Best fish quality at any Chicago sushi restaurant (along with Mirai - same executive chef).  They spent a lot of the look and ambiance, but the food can back it up."
1,-,Food was decent service was awful price was worse.
7,-,"Went based on recommendation for their micheladas. For a $3 Tecate to become a $8 cocktail it better be pretty good, but nothing about it was distinguished. Maybe a bit milder than the ones you will find at a taqueria and definitely less spicy. Shared chilaquiles and an omelette for lunch, both were good."
7,-,"Decent collection but not really on par with the Art Institute, much smaller facility. Murakami exhibit is very good."
3,-,"First time here, friendly greeting up arrival, helpful non pushy staff. Enjoying a great workout. Place is well kept. Interestingly people are working out and not on their phones. Amazing"

Also enjoyed a huge smoked chicken salad that was awesome. Sampled the 3 variations of BBQ sauce they had set out on the tables. Surprised that the sweet hot was actually pretty spicy.

6,-,"A good spot for after work or small gathering. The river patio is crowded, so get there a little earlier, but many inviting seating elsewhere. Drinks are more special than the food, which is at least good with drinks.  Very interesting atmosphere"
5,-,Solid steak on the menu
6,-,"An old school diner with all the trappings. They are the oldest in Chicago, but will move across the street in March 19. I hope the grease on the perfect home fries will make it in the move. Right of the green line and 3 blocks from u of c.   Breakfast is the choice, but I'll go there for dinner and see."
5,-,It's hit and miss to be honest
1,-,Nope
3,-,I am not really a fan of cookie dough. However that being said they do offer a small variety of ice cream and some candy selections. The three others I was with did purchase a scoop ($4) each of the cookie dough to try. All three said it was really good. So based on their opinions I give this a 4 star rating.

3,-,Just a typical place to gonget things you really don't need.
7,-,"New ramen shop in the west loop. Tried the spicy pork bowl and gyoza. The gyoza was cooked well, crispy edges and a little more chew to the center. I don't understand aioli sauce, traditional soy with some vinegar would work well or some chili oil. Bowl with egg was fine, decent heat while still being able to taste it. Service was a bit overbearing, assuming it's because they just opened."
3,-,"Excellent buffet,  great selection of foods to fit anyone's tastes."
2,-,Interesting vibe with great beer and food!!

Well we walked across the lot towards the building when a certain Cadillac caught my wife's eye.  Well I don't need to continue this story,  we bought the car that night.

3,-,"Really liked the flavor here, split a street taco platter. Very uniquely different. Overall food was right on par for being perfect in taste."

Now my to go order was not the same experience. No butter, no sour cream for the baked potato. Ribs not at all impressive. Maybe next time?"
7,-,"Food was fine, but I had to check in a sealed bag that had food from an earlier stop. Seriously?"
7,-,"Great grocery store and not just for Asian specialties, plenty of things you would see at Mariano's or Whole Foods. Fantastic produce section. It's not enormous, but it's downtown, that's the space they have to work with."

3,-,"So much activities here for the family, self pick orchard or just get it in the country store. Restaraunt foods was very good, expect crowds and a wait in lines. Do NOT order chicken and dumplings, it's just canned chicken thin flat noodle soup. Very sad for country cooking."
1,-,Its McDonald's what do you expect

2,-,Largest McDonald’s in the world. Can’t believe they changed it from Hollywood McDonald’s but the futuristic concept is great!
7,-,"The best aspects are the location and that it is an open roof in the summer. Gets very crowded after work and can be difficult to find a place to stand, let alone sit. Food and appetizers are pretty poor, drink prices are good for downtown."
8,-,"I expected so much more from this place.  I was there on a Thursday night at 6:30 for just a drink.  They were understaffed, so it took awhile.  I ordered one of the ""batched"" cocktails just because the bartender was so busy, and it was whatever.  Just poured in a glass with ice and a straw.  No garnish or anything.  I've only been here once, so maybe it was a weird moment on a weird night, but I've heard so much about this place, I expected it to be an awesome experience, and it wasn't even close."

, but if you there for a good time you dont care."
7,-,"Did not tour the facility, but they did cater the drinks at an event I attended. I do not generally drink tequila (they cannot use the word tequila since it is not made in Jalisco), but their standard and aged version were both tasty and smooth. Recommended."

3,-,"Just grabbed a coffee, nothing Special."
3,-,Very nice decor in the restaurant area. Had some appetizers mushrooms and cheese curds which were really good. I had the breaded pork tenderloin which was NOT good at all. Don't overcook the food and serve it that way.

6,-,"A small museum, but definitely worth 60 to90 minutes.  Have visited the Mexican, Greek, African American and now this.  They all say something about immigration to the US and thdn advocacy for their ethnicty.  Americans understand little about other countries and this museum relates the history, its relations with Russia and that Cossacks came from here and were tbe first democratic group before the US anf French Revolution and Have a copy of tbeir constitution to prove it.

2,-,Awesome cold brew and a nice place to work
8,-,"Beer line up is pretty good.  The bartenders always do a great job.  The pizza comes out pretty quick, even when they're super busy, and it's really good.  There's something about a stone oven pizza.  There's tons of options for making a ""Create Your Own"".  GIANT patio."

This place is an upscale pub , very nice interior and a great place to enjoy a quiet evening. Food is always consistently good and priced reasonable."
6,-,A special place in Chicago. Monthly  they have an event such as yesterday's crayfish boil.  Good food and good time. Have whole animal events from gator to hog.

9,-,Best late night food in downtown Bloomington! Better Gyros than the Chicago style place 2 doors down!
7,-,"Had a small, but good meal. Split a filet mignon which worked out to be a good sized serving without being overwhelming. Was cooked according to the request. Side of potatoes was fine, nothing special. They do not know what kind of glass to serve Armagnac in, but overall, a nice, casual experience."
3,-,"Small winery, nice visit to listen to Lick Creek  Country Band. Music outstanding! The drinks are a little pricey but understandable. Now my BIG issue is I drove over an hour to  visit and my wife and I were expecting the food listed on their website. That IS NOT the case here. They offered a Sloppy Joe, pulled pork or Chicken salad for food at $8. Portions on sandwiches were very small. Terrible decision to save money, web page should make a note of limited menus. Quite disappointed since this is in the middle of nowhere and no other options."
3,-,"I don't like Wal-Mart, stopped only so the wife could get BANANA's"
9,-,Typical burger king

3,-,"Impressed , very Impressed! This food was so flavorful and tender that it's almost beyond belief. (No I don't have any connection to this place). It's a walked in first come first serve, then your seated. This is not a large dinning area. After my experience eating here I would have zero issues with waiting for an open table. I can tell you I have every reason to return.amd try every item on their menu. Food was absoutley outstanding.  Staff encounter was perfect. Check them out!"
7,-,"Saw a cover band here. Tickets were pricey, but the band was excellent and drink prices were very reasonable. Would go again for the right band."
8,-,"I've been here several times before, and had better experiences, but this time really sucked.  The bloody Maria was not good.  SO not good that I didn't finish it.  The side salad was ok, the bacon tempura was awesome as usual, but the bartender was the worst part.  I had to sit for 5 minutes with a salad in front of me that I couldn't eat because I didn't have any silverware.  She was unattentive and on her phone constantly.  It wasn't even busy, so I shouldn't have to wait 5 minutes for anything.  She also routinely used glassware to scoop ice, which is a HUGE NO NO.  I'm a bartender, and I know this could've been an off day, but I saw a lot of bad habits, and those add up to bad bartending, and a bad customer experience."

5,-,The kind of burger you need in your life
3,-,"Three customers inside here right now. Ordered a 4 piece chicken strip meal for $4.99 with a drink and hot fudge sundae. The cashier a female brunette was not paying attention at all. Told her three times what the order was. Well I was served a three piece strip dinner. They forgot to give me the drink she ordered. Oh, also they didn't give her the hot fudge sundae she ordered. Seriously you could use some training here folks."
6,-,A burger bar it is ordinary.
3,-,Wow did we ever find an awesome hidden gem. This place is historically correct and still has the original counters and shelves. So cool! Its worth making the turn into a quite unique little village. You can almost feel the step back in time.
7,-,Decent bagels.
3,-,Short on time so stopped in for a quick breakfast. Biscuits & Gravy and a cinnamon raisin biscuit and coffee. Nothing special just ok. Did think the prices were on the high side for what they served.

7,-,Lots of expensive and cool kitchen gadgets.
7,-,"Good tacos and micheladas. Extremely difficult to get a table or even a seat at the bar, but if you can deal with the wait it is a great place to spend a warm afternoon. Tacos aren't quite traditional, but not that out there either. Service can be poor."
6,-,"Went twice.  For lunch it was forgetable.  There are better places within 2 blocks.  For dinner it was a different story.  The food was better, still not better than the mentioned four places, but the room shined.  An inviting and active bar along with private rooms galore.  A good selection of wines with more menu choices and a happy hour"
4,-,Great as usual
5,-,Good interview experience
7,-,"Great small dishes, anchovies were the standout. Service and decor were excellent."
6,-,Good spot for a quick lunch or deli selections
3,-,"Well this turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Traveling with a friend who told about this place and suggested dinner there. Place is hidden behind the Ford dealership but well worth looking for it. Walking up to the door the aroma draws you inside. Smaller location with ample seating. Menu is a challenge board on the wall. Place your order, choose your sides and you on the way to a great meal. Food was really good here and the women taking our orders was very friendly. With stopping by and trying this place if your traveling on I55."
7,-,Burger and fries are good. Chicken was flavorless.
3,-,"Shopping  with the daughter, limited dried plant selection."
3,-,"Stopped in for some frozen yogurt. It's a walkup only place with plenty of seating out front. Walk up place your order and walk to the pick-up window. It's that easy and the prices were reasonable. Todays yogurt special was German Chocolate Cake. Sure why not. Bought a medium size and was quite please that it actually tasted close to the German Chocolate cake. Yes I would definitely be back, because I saw the banana split coming out."

7,-,Love the roasted garlic they bring out to each table.  Well prepared classic Italian dishes.
3,-,Stopped in for some fresh breakfast sausage. This stuff in Pattie form is so good. Additionally while there why not pi k up a package of their fresh made on premises brats. So many varieties of flavors available. Live the Apple brats and occasionally I'll grab a package of the Root Beer brats. Where else came you find those. It's with the stop if your anywhere near 30 miles of this place.

Our waitress ""Shenea"" (spelling unknown) greeted us and took our drink orders. She was super friendly and interacted with is like she was part of our group. Happy to have here. Fresh rolls delivered and refilled. Food orders placed with food arriving in a very reasonable amount of time. Two mistakes being made by the kitchen on food prep. One steak way overcooked. Salmon was requested plain and served seasoned. Sheena took care of correcting this. After dinner we enjoyed a slice of pie and coffee. Wednesday is free pie day. Overall a great night out with a very positive dining experience.  Way to go O'Charleys and Shenea."

7,-,Great Neapolitan pizza.
2,-,"First, get the bowl not the falafel. The difference in the amount of food between the two for $1 is quite significant. Load that bowl up and get it with hot sauce! Good lunch spot."
1,-,Super busy !
7,-,"New Mexican restaurant in the West Loop. Huge space, it just keeps going, has the feeling of two separate places between front and back. Good size menu with mostly traditional choices. The table had tacos and queso with poblanos. Really good freshly made tortillas. Large tequila and mezcal selection as well."
7,-,"Good selection of high end clothing, no real competitors at that price point. Service is helpful and friendly without being overbearing."
5,-,The portions were not good for the price they're charging. Also I had bits of she'll in my oysters.....which we're about the size of a quarter. I've been to many small plate restaurants in Chicago but this is the first time my girlfriend and I have dropped $100 and left hungry enough to warrant a stop on the walk home.
6,-,Good old style deli with an excellent bakery
7,-,"Not much personally when it was built, but getting better. Food and drink option have improved greatly over the years. The team, not as much."

3,-,Excellent venue for the Chicago Pro Wings of Strength Body Building Competition.
8,-,"Cheap tickets, and good beers in the Craft Cave."
7,-,"Surprisingly large selection of beer and liquor - especially bourbon - for a burger place. Burger was good, but nothing on it had a 'bite',  to balance the tenderness of the meat and soft bun. Skinny fries were excellent, although they should be at that price. Will definitely return to try out some of the other options.

The impossible burger is not exclusive to Umami, but it is the best veggie burger available by a mile. Really good."
9,-,"Cool spot, huge seating area, good burger special on Saturdays, scallop potatoes are awesome!"

3,-,"Excellent place to buy your next vehicle. No pressure, great staff to work with and pricing is quite fair for market values. Definitely happy with the way we were treated as customers.  The real thing is the wife is happy with her new Cadillac SUV. Thats all that really matters.  Stop in and check them out its worth it. We drove from Springfield, IL because  Springfield is NOT buyer friendly. I totally recommend Jack Schmitt based on our positive experience."
6,-,"A small museum in streeterville. Open to the public, but the viewing is limited to the show on the first floor"

It was a great place to stop for a quick meal. Additionally I decided to go ahead and try one of these Mexican apple pies. Basically it's cinnamon crisps chips with melted cheddar cheese and also whipped cream sprinkle with Red Hots pretty good stuff.
4,-,Great eats as usual
2,-,Good luck trying to cancel your membership here
7,-,"Visited twice during the soft opening. Staff seems well organized and I didn't get the sense that anyone was scrambling or didn't know what was going on. First trip did not get BBQ, had bibimbap (labeled sukiyaki, but it's not sukiyaki...) instead. Pretty tasty and fares well against most Korean restaurants. Second visit had BBQ and tried most of the meats marked as their favorites. The first 5 or so were kind of bland, and only when we selected a few of our own did we find options that were really tasty. Nice atmosphere, but food just didn't stand out."
2,-,Dollar beers

3,-,"Just like always, not worth the stop."
6,-,Still the best burger. Have it their way
8,-,"This place has my favorite cocktail in the city, ""The Weston"".  Bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, and tobacco equals amazing.  I wish I could drink it all the time, but I can only get it here.  The only minus is it's pretty tiny, ( The bar itself, that is) and can fill up quickly."
7,-,"Can be difficult to find what you are looking for, everything just kind of runs together."
8,-,"There's a great little noodle shop in the back called the ""Snack Corner"".  It's really small, so it's a little cramped in there when it's busy.  They also have the super spicy ramen that everyone's doing challenges with.  The bbq pork buns from the stand out front are great."
7,-,"Drinks are insanely sweet, keep that in mind."

3,-,Good food!
7,-,"Possibly made a mistake by ordering Neapolitan style instead of deep dish. It was decent, but the dough did not have the same chewy texture really good pizzas have. Salad was good, and the bread and oil they brought out was excellent. Cool atmosphere."
6,-,An excellent wine bar on the Mag Mile.  Reasonably priced with a nice selection of wines and appetizers
6,-,"Just a sub shop. Good menu, but nothing special.  Good for sitting outdoors on Michigan Avenue"

9,-,"Nice bar, gets busy on weekends when college students are in town"
3,-,"I just watched Channel 20 news Springfield Illinois today 4-18-19 @ 6:00pm. It's pretty sad when an 80+ year old man loses a dog, who accidentally got loose. He finds out the dog is at the local Sangamon County dog pound. He is told that he has to pay $450 prior to the release of this dog or the dog is going to be euthanized. This director needs to be terminated today!  That is just ridiculous, I hope he never has a kid with an animal that gets lost. This director has no compassion and is the saddest excuse I've ever seen for an animal worker. Fire him and replace him with someone who has a heart. The only good thing is go fund me contributors save this dog's life and probably the elderly gentleman,  it's also such heartbreak not having your animal with you and knowing you are helpless because you can't afford $450 in fines. What a loser this director is."
9,-,It's Hy-Vee
2,-,"Interesting place with a Japanese American vibe. The combo for $20 includes burger, fries, and a beer!"
1,-,If you go there plan on spending the day
5,-,Historic speakeasy you need to try the ribs at
3,-,"1st time here. Very nice small restaurant with an inviting and relaxing decor. Waitress Danee was very pleasant. Placed my order for the Northern Italian Veggie thin crust Pizza just to try something different. Upon delivery it had a very nice appearance and looked perfectly baked with a slight golden color to the cheese.  I will say this was definitely NOT a thin crust pizza. Flavor was ok, it could have had a touch more spices for my taste. Overall it was a good experience dining here."
2,-,I got the mighty mick and it was delicious! Hope to try some of the food on my next visit.
7,-,"Tried out this newer traditional steak house after reading some very positive reviews. Service and ambiance were both good, many tables offer a good view of the skyline over the river. IPad wine list certainly has plenty of options, but since the servers have to explain how to use it, it comes more as a gimmick than useful. Started with the butternut squash soup and arugula salad. Both were very well done. Had the bone in filet for the entree, medium rare. The meat was good, but the outside was charred to the point that it interfered with the flavors. Overall good, but not noteworthy. As an aside, both people who tried the arugula salad had stomach 'issues' 90 minutes later. Will go to other places when in the mood for steak."
7,-,"Pretty much the same as the other Rotis in the Loop, although this location seems larger than most. Line was long, but it went fast, service is good, be ready to tell them what you want , they hustle you along. Flavors seem to have a bit too much vinegar for me compared to other Middle Eastern 'inspired' places, I can't exactly place it, but something is a bit off."
5,-,Perfect date spot for drinks and games. Perfect neighborhood bar for the area.
5,-,"Great pizza, pasta, and apps. Wine and drink selection is also great"
6,-,A good suburban spot with a gastropub menu with a lean toward italian and American.  Four people had an assortment of lunch items and everyone was happy.
7,-,"Dining room is small, but comfortable. Felt like we were the only table that did not have the duck, but the other dishes were all excellent, short ribs being the standout."
6,-,"A good neighborhood spot for locals and others.  Real friendly and patient with a first timer.  Except that you eat with your hand, picking from the platter with pieces of Ethiopian bread, it was daunting.  Everyone will find something they like. Spicy or not. A regular hangout that makes it natural"
6,-,A decent burger
3,-,"Nice to see this place, grabbed some homemade jellies."
3,-,"I had the privilege of doing business with Sports and Imports owner Mark Passoni for several years. Mark is a great guy and quite trustworthy. Additionally Mark is heavily involved in community activities which support good causes. Mark puts forth great effort to work with all his customers, to ensure they have a positive experience wether it's buying a car or serving a customers car in their onsite shop. All my experiences having been very good and I recommend him for your automotive needs."

6,-,"A typical Starbucks, both good and bad"
6,-,A good modern Irish pub. Large and impersonal.  Good for groups with plenty of space.
7,-,"The location is great, the best place to go out in that area just north of the river. Good beer selection, plenty of variety in styles. Did not try the food. Service was OK, it was not busy, but the servers did not come around very frequently considering we had a fairly large party."
1,-,No one likes sprint
3,-,Spent a day at the Octoberfest. We decided to take the brewery tour they were offering. Tour cost is $10.00 per person and seems the tours were quite popular. Whole waiting for a tour guide you have the opportunity to explore their museum which gives some detailed insight on the history and f the brewery. The tunnels we're nice to see and understand how things operated back then. Tour was interesting and fun. Recommend ya stop and enjoy this site.
2,-,"Grungy arcade Irish pub, really eclectic crowd"
6,-,A. Casual authentic taco place. Good quick service and good cheap food
6,-,"A good coffee shop with a few special features. Peets coffee. A serious assortment of bakery items,,  more than most. All looked good.  A serious fast food lunch menu that exceeds most coffee shops.  A surplus of seating for individuals parties of two or four or larger."
5,-,Food that'll fill you up and make your taste buds dance. Great beer and whiskey choices
3,-,"Awesome as always, so much to see and do here, water, walking, museum, sheds aquarium, planetarium, boating, kayaking, swimming,eating, people watching, enjoying the view, exploring, parks, traffic - ya have to love Chicago traffic as it's part of the adventure, Navy Pier, water taxi, River North and so much more."
3,-,"Portion size of the meat in this dish was very skimpy, cheese sauce is a homemade beer cheese and flavorful. At $8.99 I would not make this mistake a second time. Had some breaded cauliflower appetizers which were greasy and extremely salty. No return trip for me.
Update 9-12-17 went to lunch with coworkers. Everyone's food was either overcooked or burnt. Not a good experience at all. Sorry I gave it a second chance."
3,-,Lots of nice things here. A bit on the pricey side for what we were looking for.
7,-,"Mango was fine, we preferred the snow white dessert with red beans and herbal jelly. Pricey for what you get."
1,-,I was surprised how nice and cool every one is.
9,-,Typical strip mall
3,-,Shopping the sales
4,-,The foot massage was great
7,-,"Although most English/Irish pub fare is pretty cheap, the menu here is on the pricey side. Dishes are better than most as well, fish and chips are a stand out."
3,-,"Cool bartender, reallt a nice place with a nice comfortable atmosphere. Food well as ya already know it speaks for itself. Known all over Illinois and adjoining states for its awesome  breaded pork tenderloin sandwich.  Did I mention  its not possible to walk away from here feeling hungry. So if your anywhere near a 150+ mile radius of this place its definitely  a destination to try. Simply  prefection in the tenderloin world."
3,-,"Dirty store unkept store, pay attention employees."
4,-,A lot of fun
7,-,"The ramen is good, but noodles and broth are not on par with the best places in Chicago. Inside out buns were tasty and original. Zzajangmang was also good and had an interesting twist on the traditional style."
3,-,"Service was excellent, wait was very reasonable. Food order placed and next thing you know is it's being delivered, absolutely delicious!"
7,-,"Will need to visit again to give this place a fair shake. Food took an hour to come, apparently the order was not taken. Food was comped.  Beer selection is great, food was good, although very delayed. Cool atmosphere."
7,-,"Food and service is fine, nothing noteworthy. I don't understand all the fried chicken comments, doesn't seem very special."
3,-,We were traveling from Iowa to Central Illinois and decided to give this place a try for a late lunch. We sat outside on the front patio with a great view of the river. Staff was friendly and fast to serve you. Food delivered in a reasonable amount of time. Everything was good. I had the chicken nachos and felt they were a bit too dry for my liking. A littles more toppings would have helped. Overall it's a good place and a return trip could be in the future.
6,-,"Went to to wells street market and was upset with tempesta and the food court. The food was average and expensive when compared to bari, la appetito or graziano and the tipping system was at best criminal. Never again either location and wells street market."

7,-,"If you want a cheap bowl of pho or bahn mi, this is not the place. Service, presentation, and ambience are all excellent. The menu isn't quite traditional or fusion, somewhere in the middle. Crispy noodles with mushrooms, chicken wings, and mango with crab salad were the standouts."

Even the upper portion of the walls and the ceiling are the old original tin designs. Staff was accommodating and friendly. Orders taken and there was a slight wait for food to start arriving which wasn't really a problem since they also had a really nice bar. Food arrived and was passed around pretty evenly. No body had the wrong order or had to send anything back. Food was good and dessert CUPCAKES & Pie was excellent.

8,-,"One of my favorite beer bars in the city.  Amazing beer list, and great burgers.  The staff is awesome.  I wish I could eat here more."
7,-,"First visit yesterday. Beer selection is pretty minimal, definitely more for cocktails and liquor. Food was decent. Service was odd. Bartender would talk to us for a while and then completely ignore that drinks were empty or that we were trying to close out. It wasn't busy, so there wasn't a reason to not keep up."
4,-,The food and service was great
7,-,"Have stopped in a handful of times. Never had anything amazing, but it has been consistently good and it doesn't seem that there are any bad choices. Organic and fresh veggie options and a small but good beer selection helps. Typical brunch hours are very busy."
8,-,"I'm not really a fan of chocolate anything, but the Medium Hot Chocolate was AMAZING!!  The bartender wasn't very attentive, and the burger was ok, but the hot chocolate?  AMAZING!!!  I had no idea it would be THAT delicious."
4,-,They have what you need
6,-,"A good Korean fried chicken menu with hot and sweet soy glaze choices in both the wings or the pot stickers.  A complete menu with salads, sum mei, etc.  There are plenty of hot fried chicken places and korean and asain fried chicken, this is one of the best. Drumsticks are large. A little oricy for Chinatown"
7,-,"Good prices, will need to try some other dishes, green curry was fine."
7,-,"Uno and Due's are not that good, they get a huge out of town crowd, but the pizza is average at best."

3,-,Dinner with family in celebration of my wife's  birthday. Lonzerotti's is an old Train Station nicley decorated and comfortable. A great place to enjoy a nice meal. We enjoyed a absolutely a great dinner tonight. Check their website for menu. Nice variety of entrees. Recommended if in the area.
3,-,"Really, really good. First time eating here, kinda unique inside. Seems like 3-4 different places inside to order from.  Lool around and i have to say they offer quite a selection. So much that i quit reading the menus and just ordered a half slab of ribs and a salad. Delicious."
7,-,"Food was mediocre at best and its hard to understand what you get for $30...sauna, steam room, and hot or cold tub. All services like massages are extra."

7,-,"Good bubble tea, food is average."
5,-,Good food. slowest service ever
2,-,Did the taco special on a Wednesday and it's a pretty good deal! They have good drink specials and looks like a good spot to be for a group on the weekends.

3,-,"Big burgers cooked right, chips too greasy for me."
6,-,"A great neighborhood cafe, with a good assortment of soups, salads, sandwiches.  Now drawing from the rest of the city.  Good bar and coffee. Very casual."
7,-,Instead of tamales had arepas and some sides. Really tasty vegetarian options and elotes.
8,-,"Really nice space, and the service was great, but I really wasn't a fan of the food.  Instead of chips and salsa, you get something that is more like crackers, and some weird dipping sauces.  The tacos were just a little too ""inventive"" for my taste.  Also, this location doesn't have a bar to sit at.  I'm a bar guy.  I like sitting at the bar, and if a place that serves drinks doesn't have a bar I can sit at, it weirds me out a little."
6,-,An American take on the Brazilian steakhouse.  Business engagements or family dinners are handled with equal aplomb.   Food is terrific and ambience is great. Even went there for thanksgiving
4,-,Really nice
4,-,I almost wish I was a dog gone dog so I could go there
5,-,Great service. Bold balanced flavors. Worth the pricetag

3,-,Buying a few items
4,-,Great deals
1,-,Owner was kind of a jerk
5,-,Great food. The lime cocktail is alarmingly crushable. Good atmosphere too. My only complaint was my watery old fashioned
7,-,"It was OK, but not worth the 30-40 minute wait. Standard fair, not sure why this place gets so much buzz."
7,-,"Zombie Dust on tap, and other hard to get 3Floyds options, including Dark Lord barrel aged variants, make this place worth going to. Food is OK, but with their beer options, it doesn't really matter."

4,-,Great
7,-,Great Indian downtown.

3,-,"Good place to keep the grime off your car. Good pressures on their water. Best in my area. As an FYI, I don't use car washes that touches my paint."
3,-,"A nice real soup, salad & sandwich stop. Food is prepared fresh daily, sandwiches made fresh as ordered with you selecting a choice of bread and cheeses. Salads are nice. Risperdal fresh and large. It is a little on the steep side at the pricepoint, however you get a quality lunch."
6,-,"A must see once building which gives you an insight to wealthy chicagoans of old. Exhibits are regukar, but the value may in becoming a member for the activities of cultural chicago"
5,-,"Good food, charming staff"
7,-,"Similar to big star and de cero, tacos that cost more than a taqueria, but ingredients and quality are very high. Line can take a while during rushes. Will come back for sure. Beer could be colder."

8,-,"The broth in the high five ramen bowl was delicious, and it got tastier the deeper into the bowl you got.  Why does it have to be that dark in there?  The Coconut Painkiller was good, but I wish it was a little bigger.  The service was great, and the cold towel at the end is a nice touch."
6,-,"An excellent and friendly cigar sho p with an excellen t selection, maybe one of the better.  Its for sitting. Although it only stools."
2,-,"Fantastic beer, good vibe at all times"
2,-,"Great beer selection. Food is okay, I always get the wings because they seem to be the best food menu item. During the summer the view from the patio is very nice. Pretentious cars galore outside provides nice people/car watching"
8,-,"Fun games, but the beer selection sucks, and the bartender is usually HAMMERED.  I want to support this place, but Replay is WAY better."
7,-,"Friendly and helpful staff. Not cheap, but if you need lightweight, high-quality gear this is a good place to look."
7,-,"Had a variety of hot and cold dishes. Nothing was bad, but nothing stood out that much either. Highlights were the pork robata and the kampachi sake maki roll. The kim chee ramen and sweet potato yasai were average at best. Service was very good."

Recommend you try Kelly's."
7,-,"If you aren't in the mood for deep dish, the  Lou's Special thin crust is really good. Interesting decor, not at all like a typical pizza place."
3,-,Stopped for a beer and an appetizer. Good place to relax for a bit.
6,-,There are many good ramen shops in Chicago and this is one of the best. Its hq is Japanese. They have an assortment of three styles with 4 0r 5 choises in each of them.  Get hot sake for 4 bucks and by oass the 30 dollar ones

9,-,"Awesome hole in the wall spot. Lots of room, good prices, cash only."
4,-,What a night
6,-,Great for cheeses and wine
7,-,"Tried this 'fast casual' place for the first time. They are going for Baja/coast feeling, but that would entail seafood and there isn't any to be found...
Positives include fresh made tortillas, generous portions, baking cheese on each order, and the service. Not so positives include bland meat (chicken in this case), and beans that were ridiculously soupy - it was just black bean liquid."
7,-,"The space and atmosphere is fine, nothing special, but the beer selection is above average - the barleywine selection was awesome. Bacon wrapped dates are worth the trip as well."

Awesome place! My wife and I totally enjoyed our visit and shirt tour pointing out some of the architecture. Thanks Dave for a very fun and informative time. These photos are just a very small sampling of the curiosity museum. One of several different rooms inside here."
6,-,"Had dinner at the Atword for the first time since the redesign. I walk past and from the outside it seemed an eyesore.  I loved the old room.

3,-,"Stopoed in based on a recommendation of a local person who said they have the best food in town. Nice building newer style with a very neat clean interior. Felt comfortable walking in and noticed all the tv's tuned to a football game. Tables were clean plenty of room to kick back and relax with a drinks or food. Menus is simple with appetizers and sandwiches. You have to ask because some items are freshly made while others are pre made frozen, like mushrooms. The portion size is way above what one person should eat. Nachos where served on a 11x14 pan and puked high. (Photo includes cell for for size referrnce) Their Tenderloins are hand pounded,  breaded and large. Overall it was an enjoyable break and food was quite tasty."
7,-,Good service and large menu but the food is decidedly average even for a diner.
3,-,"Having conducted business here several times, I have no problem recommending Watches, Coins & Antiques. They are very knowledgeable and offer Springfield best prices on both purchases and sales. If you have a quality timepiece Jeff's knowledge of this is outstanding."

6,-,Just ok for kids. Otherwise terrible
4,-,Mariano's has a wonderful buffet
7,-,"Heavy Japanese influence on most dishes, which i think works better than trying to add an element of multiple Asian cuisines. Prices are on the high side, but not totally out of line with other restaurants of this quality - Japanese or otherwise.

Second visit had the 7 course tasting menu. Really enjoyed it, almost all of the dishes were outstanding, especially the pork belly and scallop."
5,-,Good staff. They listen
3,-,Stopped in for a quick to go order on my way to an event. Ordered the Arby's Classic roast beef and a medium Jamocha shake. Paid and received my order fairly quickly.  Shake looked great and it was. Sandwich was served hot. Good job staff at Arby's.

Food choices from fresh and good pizza to chacuetere, sandwich es, salads and soups. Bread both individual servings and whole loaves. Pastries far beyond those served at the coffee shops.

Spend and hour or three from coffee to an artisnal meal or snack. The atmosphere is at the same time casual, work space and elevated.  This raises the bar"

3,-,Beautiful business
6,-,Alright tacos and a good bar right after work

7,-,The chive pockets were great.
3,-,"Oh, so I have to tell you I had to buy a couple pieces of chocolate covered bacon to snack on while I browsed the display cabinets and decided what to indulge on today.

3,-,"Pick up an order of Pad Thai, egg rolls and crab Rangoon. Very good food. Recommend you give it a try."

4,-,"Nice store to shop in, could have been a little bit less expensive but great boots"
3,-,"Very nice small town cafe which served up a good breakfast. (Hint, don't buy the pie it's diet size slices) Busy place, the service was good and staff friendly."
6,-,"Why go to Starbucks when you can go here.  Plus ice creams, cakes and other choices"
7,-,"Despite being essentially under the Green Line, Vera has a calm, quiet ambiance, althoug it was early in the evening. Had a few of the small dishes, the kale salad and bacon wrapped dates were standouts. Good tapas, but a very different low-key atmosphere compared to Iberico or Cafe Ba Ba Reeba if you are looking for something a bit more subdued."
2,-,The dragon roll mixed with the jalapeño gin drink was nuts
5,-,Very posh
5,-,Good coffee and the staff is great

6,-,A good breakfast spot in an underserved area

1,-,Same old
8,-,Beer list is ok.  Bartenders are awesome.

6,-,A great meeting place. Books coffee and wine
8,-,"I was pretty lit when I was here, so I don't remember much, but I do remember the bartender was pretty cool.  FOUR STARS!!  All kidding aside, this is one of the more mellow spots in Boystown, if you just want to hear each other talk, and have some beers."
7,-,"Grass fed steak was OK, nothing special. Mac n cheese was really good."
3,-,Who doesn't love a bakery? I went I side to find a lot of people here. The selection looked amazing. Wasn't sure what I was even looking at on some of the items. I selected a pastry which was called a Honey Noodle which had the appearance of a rice crispy treats. Well I really do t have an opinion on it. After sharing it with the other 3 people I was with we ended up throwing it away. I'm sure it's good if you like that type of food.

2,-,Best bar in river north!!
5,-,HUGE. Good selection and nice staff
6,-,"An excellent wine bar and retail store.  24 different self serve choices. Self serve and you can get a taste, a half glass or glass.  A reasonable way to wine taste to your hearts content.  By the end of the night you can genuiny pick one or two you want.  Thats a success.  They have a nice, but limited retail space. Dont look for Walgreen or Binny Selections.  But they have a good price range.  They have beer hard liquor, bread, cheese and meats retail.
They have chacuterie plates for matching your tasting.  Go there once a month or regularly.."
8,-,"I haven't had the pizza, so this rating is strictly for the service, and the Italian sub.  The sub was very good!  It's no Bari, but it was very tasty!"
3,-,"Very nice 1st impression, large place very open and bright inside. One thing that really stuck out immediately was how loud the music was a d the place was only about a third full. Way to loud for me. Sat at some comfortable large tables and were told it's brunch only until 2:00pm. The brunch was a combo of breakfast bar on one side of the room and lunch bar on the other. More than enough variety to please anyone. I also would have preferred to order from a menu.  The meats on the buffet were kinda dry. I'll definitely return however no more buffet for me."
4,-,They always have a great deal
8,-,Pretty good beer line up.  Live entertainment pretty much every night.  I use to go here quite a bit when I lived in Bridgeport.

7,-,"Most Thai places are decent, nothing amazing but they get the basics right. The food here was missing even basic favor profiles of Thai food. Chicken was boiled and unseasoned. Curry was plain as well, just nothing really going on."
5,-,Worth a visit. Great beer selection
5,-,A huge upgrade from other fast food places
3,-,"Traveling with my wife and we love to check out local diners and cafes. This find is a hidden surprise. It's and old block building surrounded by a gravel lot full of holes. The front door welcomes your arrival. The daily food special sign is right there as you enter. Open seats and most tables hold 6 or more people. Friendly people, met a local older gentleman who was leaving. Had to ask him what he suggested for breakfast. His reply..... anything that doesn't crawl off the table, haha good one. Breakfast was great and prices are reasonable. Food was outstanding. Definitely coming back here!"
2,-,One of the best bars in wrigleyville. Good atmosphere and they usually have good beer specials.
3,-,"Really nice lunch today, authentic Mexican foods."

2,-,Nice bar near the L
1,-,Ware house help are super rude . Whole ordeal was a bad experience
1,-,If it's the club it's super fun but dangerous.
7,-,"Fantastic pasta made in house. Small, focused menu. Portions are small, unlike most Italian places, so you need to order more dishes than normal.  Everything we had was very good. Standout dishes included tuna arancini, cannelloni with lamb, and cacio pepe."
9,-,Huge bingo hall. Bingo every nite at 6.
6,-,A good neighborhood spot with a welcoming atmosphere. Food was very good. The deli sandwiches were far above average and a pleasant surprise for someone who knows deli. Potato pancakes were also good but needed a little onion. Have a complete breakfast menu for the next time I go
3,-,"Mixed thoughts, cashier was friendly and food arrived fresh and hot.  A touch salty for me. Now let's talk about the floor. This place could use a serious steam power wash. It was very greasy as you walked across it. Not good KFC."
6,-,A great European style review. With torch singers and clowns and magicians. It reminds one of the Cabaret in the same titled movie.
7,-,"Barnaby's are pretty consistent, but the pizza here was better than a few of the others. Decent, thin crust. Cash only."
4,-,Great variety
3,-,Took the daughter shopping and it only cost me $32. Wow!

8,-,"I don't know why, but I didn't get my chicken sandwich on a glazed donut.  Definitely next time."

3,-,"They are all the same, gas snacks and a drink."
3,-,"I am not from the area. I stopped in for some fruit and noticed immediately how how high the produce prices are. Even with that, I made my selection and purchased just over $20 in product. This photo contains a photo of a very rude cashier. I should have left my purchase right there and walked out. They will not see repeat business from me. Please notice the sign above this cashier."
7,-,Ice cream is fine but $7 for a single scoop cone is obnoxious.
2,-,Relaxing coffee joint right by merchandise mart with awesome ice coffee!!
7,-,"Nothing special, nicer atmosphere than My Thai, but the food is very average. Spring rolls appeared to be drenched in pancake syrup, far too sweet."
4,-,Just good
2,-,Place is crazy upstairs
7,-,"New spot on Taylor, no standout dishes, but everything was pretty good."
3,-,"A little after Christmas shopping to pick up gifts for people were going to spend New year's Eve with. Sam's never disappoints, they have a large variety and a great selection of items."

5,-,Best breakfast croissant ever
6,-,"An old school italian which a bit of a relief from some of the pretenders. About 2 or 3 dollars cheaper, they dont charge you for the pretense.  Food was very good and the service steady. Room is nice. Great before a play"
7,-,Great dogs and Italian beef.
3,-,"Went Halloween shopping, scored love my purchases."
3,-,"The sign in the window showing three fresh tacos drew me inside. Very nice setup located on the corner of a busy I tersection downtown. Order placed, drinks received and picked a table. A short time later lunch arrived. Tacos $7.99 and they were delicious."
6,-,A very good italian beef spot.  Had three types of pepper and it wasnt too wet.  The only black mark was frozen fries
3,-,Absoutley a beautiful day to enjoy this magnificent location. Very relaxing paved and wood chipped trails.
7,-,Great venue for FOBAB every fall.
6,-,"After writing quite a few of these ive decided to become a lii
Ttle more critical and i thank Bandera for showing me tbe way.  A great room with a good bar, excellent views and a good jazz trio. Its Tuesday night and its full.  Who could ask for anything more.  I could. The food andthe service were at best uninspired.  The portions were good but the preparation poor. I dont think ive ever had red cabbage as bad.  When they bring you the plastic containers to prepare your own doggie bag i cant be more annoyed.  As i walked home i walked by two shuttered spots.  This is too packed to care"
1,-,Never had a bad time there except one bartender that wasn't very friendly

8,-,"Great place for lunch, with all the options."
6,-,Office building with sandwich shop and a good cafe
6,-,"A bit of a disappointment. I eat there a lot and got depandant on the non sushi menu, which got hits and misses. I have ordered sushi twice before and was underwhelmed third time was the charm. It was bad. The rice, the fish, the cut was all bad.  Go there for somethings, bout not sushi"
7,-,High quality​ gear and on site repairs.
2,-,Did a peanut butter donut for takeaway with a coffee and it was a great morning!!
4,-,Always good food
6,-,"""A WORKINGMANS AMERICAN RESTUARANT"" KEVIN HICKEY FOUNDER.  i would agree with a few exceptions.  The food is specially prepared, but simple food.  The grilled whitefish was prepared exceptionally.  Spaghetti and snails was great.  The biggest quible was the wine glasses.  Works of art with a glass for each grape.  Watching a guest swirling a burgandy glass was sensual, but workman like. Go.  A simple but nice bar."
3,-,Seems to have more than enough space and products to fit just about anyone's snack preference. Also has some really nice fried chicken which was quite tasty.
3,-,I really dont like this store. It has a tendency to make my family really overspend. Great selections. So my thing is to buy a large bag of Carmel corn with the goal of having some left when they are done shopping. Never works I still end up paying for an empty bag.
7,-,"Good falafel and a variety of add-ons. Chaotic since it's new, but service was decent."
5,-,Solid no nonsense food
3,-,"Playing phone ng pong, having a beer, talking with friends, enjoying the night."

9,-,"Typical uhaul spot, can be very busy with long wait times"
5,-,"Hands down, in multiple states, THE BEST AL PASTOR I'VE EVER HAD"
8,-,"Great place for a trim.  They have some bourbon for you to sip on while you wait for a chair, and they do a hot towel on your face after they line up your beard.  Love it.  Definitely make an appointment ahead of time.  These guys get booked up most days."
6,-,It was pre opening night and I was put of by their using plastic cups for the wine. Made a lasting impression

1,-,They are ok . Kind of a rough spot though
6,-,"A gem of apark and building. Used to be a country club. Refurbished by the Chicago park district.  Golf, restuarant meeting rooms and events"
3,-,"Only when I have to, just don't like the way this store is set up and it's always trashed."
7,-,"Good pho, but not amazing. Service was fair."
7,-,"Very cool brewpub in Pilsen. The entrance is well hidden from the street, so it's easy to miss, but keep looking, it's worth it. Great space on the inside, minimal furnishings but not at all cold. Small menu, but the options we tried were all good. All I can suggest is maybe tailor the menu to reflect Pilsen a bit more."
7,-,"Food is average at best, but with no other Mexican options very close it is a reasonable place if that is what you are after."
1,-,Chinese food
3,-,"Never get a bad meal here. Most of my visits here are breakfast, but hey ya gotta break this rules sometimes. Food served fresh and hot. Waitress Abreil fantastic."
6,-,"An ok Nepalese indian restaurant in the South Loop. A good, if limited, lunch smorgasbord"
3,-,Wow everything here is top quality! Looks to have a fabulous selection of imported olive oils and other food items. Stop in and grab something special.
7,-,"Nice gear, tries to be a bit more fashionable than competition."
6,-,A great casual cuban restaurant
6,-,"A South Loop stalwart.  An excellent bar and food combo which gets the food right.  Great atmosphere  with the front being a real bar and the back being a giant area for more casual dining or drinking. Good for groups. It's a Polish heritage so if you want Polish vodka, beer and perogies this is your spot. Great thin crust pizza. Spacious patio"
7,-,"Solid omelettes and hash browns, fairly typical diner style."
7,-,"Friendly staff, good sandwiches."
1,-,Not a fan of customer service or western union there
7,-,"Good thin crust, too heavy on the cornmeal."
9,-,Good food. Decent service.
7,-,Nice that the Chicago locations were consolidated into one large showroom where they have almost everything in the catalog.
4,-,Nice place to shop
6,-,"First try in their soft opening. The place is visually arresting and add real compliment to what is a foodies restaurant block. You could eat every day of the week at the block.
The food was good, fast and casual. Have the cucumber salad and fried shrimp and pork dumplings. The sauces need something extra"
3,-,"I give this a 3 because I believe they could improve on their pizza flavor a bit. The crust to me tasted like an unsalted saltiness cracker. This is the only pizza place in miles and it's not bad, it's just not memorable. Update 9-29-17 ordered another pizza, this one was quite good. Changed my rating to 4 star."
1,-,Private club that is very nice clean friendly and family oriented
3,-,Picking up a few lightbulbs
2,-,Good vibe tons of TVs

8,-,"Great cocktails, a solid food menu, and the kitchen is open until 1 every night.  One of my new favorite bars in the area!"
2,-,Great drinks good atmosphere. Good dance spot after 10 pm Friday and Saturday but there might be a line!

4,-,The catfish is outstanding
4,-,Great law firm
7,-,Small selection of relatively hard to find sneakers.

5,-,Great for the wedding we attended
3,-,"New owners im told, definite communication between owner and kitchen help. Giant tenderloin....Not even close."
6,-,Went there for happy hour which was very satisfying.  The room is beautiful and the views are good. I want to go for lunch or dinner to check out their menu and delivery
3,-,"I really think they forgot to put the filling inside this Calzone. It is basically empty. To bad flavor was pretty good. There is no way this should have ever left the kitchen, it's totally embarrassing.
7-19-17 return trip with family. This time I have nothing but positive to say about the food. All our dishes were really good. We had the pulled pork nachos, a Chicken parmesan sandwich and spicy Mexican quesadilla."

9,-,"Just stopped for drinks, seems to have a great food menu tho! A salad bar set up in the back. Big stage up front. Very friendly bartender on a Sunday afternoon!"
4,-,Beautiful place but the fish ain't biting
8,-,"I highly recommend trying to get a seat at the bar, and getting the burger.  It's fantastic.  Possibly one of the best in the city.  But you can't get it unless your sitting at the bar.  It's weird, but it's their thing.  Also, the bar is small, so try to go during ""off peak"" hours.  The bartenders are great, and the beer line up is solid.  They also have a patio, but go have a drink on the patio after you had the burger at the bar."
8,-,"Fantastic fish n chips, and the bartender was great.  He made a clover with Guinness foam!"
8,-,This is one of my favorite beer bars in the city.  Always a great selection.

Another trip and another stay here, met Nina who checked us in. Very nice. Great place."
2,-,Wasabi Bloody Mary changed my life
5,-,Great food and drinks. If you have food allergies they are beyond accommodating.
7,-,"The food options look very good, I was able to try the taco and Indian spot, happy with both. The logistics need some work, some places ran out of different dishes and there are items made in the back so there are runners all over the place. Tried the katsu sandwich at Mom's, it's exceptional."
1,-,Good service didnt have what I needed though
2,-,Crazy vibes here with darts games and good music!
1,-,Expensive but great place.

3,-,Looking for a pull behind yard cart.
3,-,I had the BurRita Deluxe which wasn't too bad. Very similar to other burritos in size and flavor. Plenty of varied items to choose from on their menu. With stopping in for dinner again.
6,-,"Wait to see. It was very good on the first visit. A well designed space with a rotating bar, which they didnt tell me about to see the surprise.  The menu is very interesting with a lot to choose from. A French slant. Food was good, but I had a limited sample. Wii go back to test more fully"
6,-,Typical Greek American breakfast and lunch spot.  Good value
7,-,"Had soup and salad. I assume pizza and pasta are stronger options as neither dish I had was good, and the tomato soup was like warmed up tomato sauce."
6,-,A good coffee shop in andersonville. Nice selection or all types of snacks including beer and wine. Nice setting
8,-,There's nothing here for me.  I don't even know why I went in.
7,-,"Good for wings,  jia jiang myun, and cham pong.  Please excuse the spelling errors."

3,-,Very good food! Freshly made with fresh ingredients. Flavor was awesome. Good choice for breakfast.
7,-,"Great Mexican place on the north side. Nicer than a taqueria but still comfortable and casual. Tried a variety of dishes, portions were large and everything was really good, especially the tamale."
8,-,Great cocktails.  Why is it so dark in there?
7,-,"Had the 8 oz filet and it was fantastic. Nothing fancy, just pepper and salt and done perfectly. Side dishes were very good as well, creamed spinach with bacon. The smoked pork chops were a little dry, but the mashed potatoes that came with were fantastic. Service was very attentive. Not many wine selections by the glass, almost everything is by the bottle - and quite pricey."
3,-,"So when you in the middle of nowhere with nothing to do, this place is a must stop. Homemade pies, fresh hand battered onion rings and fresh made tenderloin. Good food!"
3,-,Pork Tenderloin sandwich tonight. Unfortunately they exceeded the normal acceptable limit for salt. Extremely salty. Yuck.
3,-,Just another high priced grocery store
3,-,Stop in for a sweet treat.
8,-,"Fantastic beer list!  They have the best beer list in the city, as far as venues go.  I would just come to drink beer, and not even see a show.  The venue part is great, too."
3,-,Had the best opportunity to attend a tour of the Collins Street Old Joliet Prison. Tour was a few hours long which was nowhere near enough time to enjoy the faciality. So many stories and so much history here to discover.  People holding the tour were quite knowledgeable. I highly suggest watching this location for the next tour openings which I understand might be in march of 2019. It's definitely worth the trip.
6,-,A very Shrek Chinese french bakery
5,-,Pretty good deep dish
3,-,Such a cool place to host an event. Staff is on hand for anything you might need.
7,-,"Staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and relaxed, no pressure to buy. Prices on trade ins are very fair."

7,-,"Recently visited this newish restaurant that serves classic Italian. Started with a mixed salad and calamari. Salad greens were fresh and crisp, the squid had a very light batter, both dishes were excellent. Main course of canestri with sausage and a filet mignon. Steak was done perfectly. Pasta was flavorful and the sausage showed a great blend of spices. Nothing especially innovative on the menu, but every dish appears to be executed flawlessly."

5,-,Good place for date night
7,-,"Tiger Cry and the entrees (catfish in red curry paste, and sweet potatoes in yellow curry), were very good, but the rice was awful and had to be replaced. Maybe a small thing, but rice at a Thai restaurant should never be an issue."

1,-,Cheap tools to get the job done then they break

3,-,So I have to start by saying my first experience here was with the body shop who was fantastic. After my in person conversation with them I was taken to the front sales area to look for a possible replacement vehicle. Met the salesperson and the general manager. Test drove a car and spoke about the accident a d insurance replacement. All was good that day. Tried calling for updates several times either to get no answer or no return phone call. Went back and test drove the car we believed would be the replacement. Nice car. But that's where it's ends. No movement on the vehicles price at all. No return calls from the dealership after about 5-6 calls. When I did get a hold of them they were very interested in talking to me but they did not move off the price at all. So based on the extremely poor business practice I decided to NOT do business there. I started looking at other vehicles and ended up buy a new Mercedes. The Mercedes dealership without a doubt was just the opposite experience. What a great store and possibly one theo  best buying experience I've half. I can to and will not recommend this Jaguar dealership to anyone. Buyer beware!!!
3,-,"Spent some time looking around and visiting dealerships over the past few weeks. I kept going back to an Acura TLX as my choice. I made a phone call to Bob Lindsay Acura. I talked with Tim Lipsey explaining I have a strong interest in one of the vehicles listed in their inventory. Tim informed me he wanted to put hands on the vehicle to ensure they still have it. He confirmed it was in stock. Perfect, we set an appointment, where I learned it was his day off. I told him I can make another day. Not necessary, I would be happy to meet with you. On arrival the car I was interested in was inside a customer viewing area. The car was spotless!!! What I found really amazing is every employee I encountered during my time walking around looking, both inside and outside of the building greeted me. I came prepared with research on the vehicle I was interested in. Not needed, they exceeded those figures in their offer. I received what I considered a very fair deal for both of us. Amazingly I went through a seamless very professional negotiation and purchase. My experience here rates this dealership and staff as Fantastic!!!
3-13-18 I'm back for an oil change and tire rotation.Honsetly this is the best dealership I have dealt with. They definitely are interested in their customers first. No pressure sales at all."

Owner has his ""crew"" seated at the bar and usually has food, for them only, every time I've been in, very cliquey! Typical patrons are very loud and immature, as we were forced to listen to a conversation about prostitutes last time in, as you couldn't talk to the person sitting in the seat next to you, because the crowd had to yell over each other."

Lots of beer and liquor, tons of unique drinks and shots. The brand new building looks amazing! Staff is extremely helpful and pleasant. Can't find a place like this anyehere else in McLean county. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
7,-,"May need to go back and try other options, but almost $10 for a very average bowl of chili is steep. Overdone on the tomatoes, needs more spices and other ingredients to balance it out."

The food was prepared to a tee. The smoked salmon, the roasted eggs, the french toast, the seafood platter were all first class. You get used to the dj and noise and accept it.  It is a gen x and millenials place on sunday, but a real steakhouse by night.  Hats off to our waiter Jaime who was as special as the pkace.  The drinks are great"

3,-,1st visit here for dinner since opening. Waitress Janel very nice and good at checking up on our table. We we're seated approx 6:19pm according to a receipt from a purchase from a store across the street. Our food arrived at 7:22pm. No reason at all for an hour wait for food. Once served the food was very good. Once they get the kitchen problem corrected things should improve. Will definitely be returning as the food is not the issue. It was delicious.

5,-,Good fast food while being real food too
7,-,"I almost never give out 5 stars, but this place is worth it. Immediate contender for best pizza in Chicago. Lot of variety, creative toppings, fresh ingredients, and an amazing crisp crust. The cheeses are fantastic as well. Very crowded and the space is tight, I don't think the crowds will go away, the hype is real."

3,-,Shopping for some grilling meats.
8,-,Fantastic selection of alcohol.
3,-,"Well first time here, place is interesting and geared for tourist. I found it not to be that interesting. What surprised me is it definitely is not clean, very run down in appearance. Sad but this alley photo was the thing that caught my attention."

Stainless steel appliances and granite  counters.  Apartments I looked at was still being worked on however the progress looked good. Outside is being painted a nice gray with accepting colors.

3,-,Nice small village with some interesting shops.
4,-,Best pizza in the world
6,-,A unique spot that has meaningful art and architecture event. It also has a small library and a bookstore

2,-,Got a poke bowl at 2 am and it was good. Next time I will try the ramen as it looked much better than the poke.

4,-,Nice place to shop for your furniture
8,-,"I've ended up here many a late night.  The beer selection isn't that great, but it's the only 4am in the area, and if you want to drink at a bar after 2 around here, you can't be picky."
5,-,"Great experience, not a hard sell"
5,-,Best service and selection

However, the 2nd is different. They have everytype of brewed coffee inluding pour over, franch press and siphon method. The also have icecream desserts.  Its very spacious and has some interesting design elements. Same ability to sit all afternoon"
3,-,Place is historical and nicely kept. My advice is do not eat at they're restaurant. Was not at all impressed with the food.
3,-,Wasn't impressed with the car show held at this location. We did not go inside. This Corvette was amazing
9,-,It's petco
7,-,"Great new taqueria from Rick Bayless. In a plate you get 4 fresh made tortillas and fillings to make your own (meat, onion, grilled pepper, salsa). The steak is definitely a step up from typical taquerias - quality meat and very tender. Add a side and it's not cheap, but the quality is worth it. Good selection of guest beers and a handful made on the premises with a variety of styles. If they add micheladas at the bar this is 5 stars for sure."

3,-,"Oh I found a new place. Walking around Alton, IL yesterday because it was just beautiful outside. We came across this gem. No indoor seating, which is a plus because it's so tempting to order more. They do have a covered outdoor seating area to enjoy. So what did I order, just about all the small sample size pastries. Wow were they good. As many times as I've been through Alton and it took me this long to find it."
7,-,"Thin crust is good, a bit heavy on the cheese considering how thin the pizza is. Plentiful toppings."
5,-,Divey cheap and fun.
3,-,It was ok

3,-,Just a quick simple bite before hitting the highway.
9,-,They do a great job! Have always gotten a pick up. Great drivers!
6,-,"A major disappointment considering its lineage.   The food was average and the atmosphere was just ok. The mussels,  although prepared well were at best one half an appetizer portion with regular American fries. The bread for the average pate was entirely too massive   the dessert offering was equally disappointing.  I wont go back given the choices available in chicago"
1,-,Junk rooms but decent staff. Fire department only got called once during my last stay
3,-,"Simply  an awesome place, and a beautiful lady makes it even better."

7,-,Good selection and service is always above average. Prices are very high for most items though.
5,-,Good food and beers. Friendly staff.
7,-,"Really enjoyed first visit to the month old pizza restaurant. Had three pizzas - margherita, 4 cheese, and diavolo - all excellent. The smoked mozzarella and gouda on the four cheese is so rich it feels like there is meat on the pizza. Crust and sauce are awesome. Service was excellent. The owner stopped by the table and we got a tour of the dough making room, climate and humidity controlled. Will go back, highly recommended."

6,-,"Not bad for a true kosher restaurant.  Its two places one a restuarant and the other a snack coffee shop. Reasonable bbq, just dont expect pork.  It has three themes one is the perplexed which is a take off on the great hebrew scholar, two jews in baseball and three charity. All profits are donated to a wide range of secular charities."
3,-,"You can always count on good frozen custard. Stopped in today for a Turtle concrete. Was not disappointed, it was quite enjoyable."

2,-,"Everything is amazing here. I used to go here once a week while traveling for work. I would get a salad upstairs with a pizza, walk around in the endless shopping, get a coffee with a gelato afterwards downstairs. What's not to love, most authentic Italian spot in Chicago!"
7,-,Nachos are pretty good and the beer selection is decent.
6,-,An excellent place with a good wine selection and chacuterie
7,-,"Nice facility, plenty of things to do outside of the races."
2,-,This place is awesome so many plants and chandeliers
1,-,Lot of testing for 10 bucks a hour
3,-,Had a good experience with the sales person and others working here. However the paperwork with the finance manager was the worst I have ever experienced. I buy and rotate three cars in the family frequently and have experience with the process. Honestly Lanmark Cadillac needs to replace their finance person. Outside of that it was a good experience.
7,-,"Phenomenal selection. Helpful staff will guide you through the process for whatever type of lighting project you have. Prices are not cheap, but they have some very unique pieces."
6,-,"It's ok, nothing very good or bad. I hesitate to be very critical because of the pandemic. Pizza was very average"

1,-,Doller general workers are jerks
5,-,The scenery makes this place
4,-,They make a great whopper
7,-,Great sandwiches and focaccia.

7,-,"Didn't look at all the offerings, but there aren't many places that have A.P.C. jeans in Chicago and Penelope's does, which gives it an advantage over may places. Staff was friendly and helpful."
2,-,"Very eclectic spot that seems to be an old warehouse. Rotating cocktails were nice and the beer selection is pretty standard. The pizza was the best part, although it's very light so if you have more than 2 people I would order more than one pizza!"
6,-,Once a principal hamburger spot in Chicago with many locations. Now the only one. Still good
6,-,A good lunch place withgood food and good service.  Expect it to be crowded and fast
6,-,"A modern casual space with a complete menu of pizzas and salads. I had my usual standard pizza margarita, which was very good.  on the other half a carbonara pizza which was very tasty a little sweet. The specialty is a half and half pizza. As you can tell I could have picked two more diverse style. A tad pricey"

2,-,"Got late night pizza here, it's not the best pizza in Chicago by any means"
6,-,"A nice spot off the beaten path in the West loop. A casual and quiet Italian restaurant that is very attractive and intimate. The food was not special, but satisfying.  The wine list is exactly what you would want if not extensive.  Had mussels and clams and a tomato and cucumbers salad and I would give both a 7.  The atmosphere would bring me back"
2,-,Wowwww the pork belly bao bun is insane here! Awesome vibe in this restaurant well decorated!
5,-,Good value and always tastes fresh

5,-,The perfect burger when you want something free of pretention
7,-,"Went with friends based on recommendation from ABC's pizza reviews as Dinotto was in the top 5 for Neapolitan style. While good, it didn't stand out, the crust didn't have the same consistency as some of the other very best available. Good atmosphere and location."
7,-,Awesome sandwiches
5,-,I had fun nailing my girlfriend there
4,-,Oh it was delicious and at a great price
4,-,Wonderful as always
7,-,"I don't really understand the need for a bar, but the post remodel had a good layout and selection."
3,-,"Wife and I met a friend here for breakfast. Nice relaxing atmosphere with a different style of Seating. Longer 6-8 top tables. Seating on the main level is limited however they do have a second level to accommodate you. Staff all came out at some point to greet us or check on our meals, including the chef. Food was very good and served nice and hot. Totally enjoyed this place."
